Repetto first rose to prominence with the creation of the Cendrillon ballerina flat, specifically designed for Brigitte Bardot's role in the 1956 film, “Et Dieu… créa la femme.” This design not only cemented Repetto's reputation as a premier provider of ballet shoes for top French ballet companies, including the National Opera of Paris but also marked the brand's foray into mainstream fashion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Repetto has expanded its repertoire beyond the ballet world and has collaborated with major fashion houses including Issey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto, Comme des Garcons, Karl Lagerfeld, and currently Noir Kei Ninomiya. Today, in addition to the Cendrillon flats, Repetto's range now includes a variety of styles from the popular Camille trotter heel which is a ballet pump to ankle boots, heeled sandals, loafers, Mary Janes, and even sneakers. Repetto's iconic flats continue to be a favorite among a new generation of it-girls, with trendsetters like Lily-Rose Depp and Hailey Bieber among its admirers.
