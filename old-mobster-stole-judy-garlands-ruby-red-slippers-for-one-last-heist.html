However, the iconic footwear was stolen from the Judy Garland museum back in 2005 – and now we finally know why.</strong></p><p>The case of Judy Garland’s long-lost ruby red slippers took 13 years to solve – and even longer for someone to answer for it. The iconic shoes were stolen back in 2005 and were not recovered by the FBI until 2018. The shoes were insured for $1 million, but federal prosecutors say the current market value of the recognizable <a href=#>movie</a> prop stands at $3.5 million. The ruby red slippers became a huge part of <a href=#>Hollywood</a> history when Dorothy Gale – portrayed by Judy Garland – wore them in The Wizard of Oz (1939). It’s become an American classic, loved by millions around the world, with the story being based on the 1900 novel by L Frank Baum.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-judy-garland-s-ruby-red-slippers-went-missing-almost-20-years-ago>Judy Garland’s ruby red slippers went missing almost 20 years ago</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1934806814-1024x779.jpg><p>A pair of the slippers were stolen from the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota – the <a href=#>celebrity</a>‘s hometown – in 2005.</p><p>There were actually several pairs used in the production of the cinema classic, with just four pairs known to remain. They are also widely seen as the most recognizable memorabilia in the Hollywood film history.</p><p>The FBI say the shoes, also called the ‘traveling pair’, were taken overnight on August 27, 2005. Despite investigations by the local forces, they were never found. Cops conducted countless interviews, searched in various locations including abandoned iron ore pits and considered many theories. But they enlisted the help of the FBI in 2017, 12 years later.</p><p>It wouldn’t be until July 2018 when they turned up. The FBI <a href=# rel=nofollow>sent the ruby red slippers</a> to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History to analyze them against other pairs Judy Garland wore from the film.</p><p>This development only took place after an individual approached the insurer to say they had information about the shoes, and how they could retrieve them. However, cops later said it was part of a scheme.</p><p>“When it became apparent that those involved were in reality attempting to extort the owners of the slippers,” Special Agent Christopher Dudley of the FBI said.</p><p>Reports showed the slippers’ construction, materials and general wear and tear, matched the pair in the museum’s collection, and believed to be real. The current pair at the Smithsonian has been in its possession since 1979, given by an anonymous donor.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-former-mobster-thought-the-shoes-had-real-jewels>Former mobster thought the shoes had ‘real jewels’</h2><p>Now, years later, we’ve come full circle to find out why Judy Garland’s ruby red slippers were taken in the first place.</p><p>Terry Jon Martin, who has admitted to stealing the shoes, will be sentenced next week (January 29). His defense attorney has revealed Martin wanted to be a part of ‘one final score’ so agreed to the heist. He was tempted after an old mob associate told him the famous shoes had real jewels, and that’s why they were insured for $1m.</p><p>In October last year, Martin pleaded guilty to smashing the glass of the museum door and glass case where the shoes were kept in with a hammer. But, his plan fell apart when he tried to sell them. He was then told they were not real rubies, and instead, the shoes were made from glass.</p><p>Martin ditched them less than two days after stealing them.</p><p>Defense attorney Dane DeKrey said: “At first, Terry declined the invitation to participate in the heist. But old habits die hard, and the thought of a ‘final score’ kept him up at night.</p><p>“After much contemplation, Terry had a criminal relapse and decided to participate in the theft.”</p><p>Martin is currently in hospice care and has been given a life expectancy of less than six months, <a href=# rel=nofollow>writes</a> Deadline.</p><p>The other two pairs of shoes known to still exist include a pair held by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and a private collector.</p><p><strong>MORE</strong>: <a href=#>Nicole Kidman was told she was ‘too tall’ to have a career in Hollywood</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-judy-garland-s-ruby-slippers-weren-t-meant-to-be-red>Judy Garland’s ruby slippers weren’t meant to be red</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-134985094-1024x683.jpg><p>Although the red glitzy pumps are iconic, they were not meant to be red.</p><p>In the book, they were described as silver, but due to the new Technicolor technology at the time, MGM chose to change them to the deep red color we now know today.</p><p><a href=#>Fashion</a> expert Gilbert Adrian created the slippers for the film, working as the studios’ chief costume designer. They were made using white pumps as the base, then were covered with red fabric and the soles were painted red. Sequins, rhinestones, and three kinds of beads were used to create the ruby look.</p><p>The shoes are a size 5, but some have noted that on the pairs still in existence, they may not be a perfect match. The left shoe has a marked ‘5C’ on them, when the right has ‘5BC’.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2d%2FcLvLnWSmp5Kowaa%2BjKyrqKSVYre2sNhmnpqqnJa7pb%2BMq6ybsV2nsqV50qWgqaiVp8Buss6rZKimlWK5or%2FTZp%2BeoaOpfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
