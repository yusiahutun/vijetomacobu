At its current size, the jackpot ranks as the sixth-largest in game history.</p><p>Without a jackpot winner in Saturday night’s drawing, the Powerball grand prize is now estimated at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$645 million</a>. That’s the 12th-largest in Powerball history.</p><p>With all of this money at stake, you may be tempted to buy a ticket, or two, or maybe three. Here are five things to know before playing Powerball or Mega Millions.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What are my odds of winning the jackpots?</h3><p>If you’ve played the lottery before, you know your odds of hitting the big payout are slim.</p><p>You have a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>1 in 24 chance</a> of winning any payout, ranging from $2 to the jackpot, in Mega Millions. Your&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>chances</a>&nbsp;of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are roughly 1 in 302.6 million. Your odds are slightly better when it comes to Powerball, where you have a 1 in 24.87 chance at any prize, ranging from $4 to the jackpot. Your chances of actually hitting the jackpot are about 1 in 292.2 million.</p><a href=# class=promo-link__link>Powerball: Can you increase your winning odds?</a><p>There are some methods that lottery players swear by to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">increase their odds at the Mega Millions and Powerball jackpots</a>, though. Still, you have a better chance of being attacked by a grizzly bear in Yellowstone National Park (roughly&nbsp;<a href=#>1 in 2.7 million</a>&nbsp;for all park visitors) or an alligator in Florida (about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>1 in 3.1 million</a>) than winning either.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How much of my winnings would go to taxes?</h3><p>While the odds may be stacked against you, someone will, inevitably, win. That doesn’t mean they’ll get the full advertised payout (or payouts, if they win both available jackpots).</p><p>In both Mega Millions and Powerball, jackpot winners have two payout options to select from: the annuitized prize (the advertised $875 million and $645 million, respectively) or the cash payout&nbsp;($413.5 million or $307.3 million, respectively). Regardless of the payout they select, jackpot winners <a href=#>see a large chunk of their funds withheld for taxes</a>.</p><a href=# class=promo-link__link>These are the best, worst states to win the lottery in</a><p>Though&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>some states do not have a state lottery tax withholding</a>, they all must withhold 24% in federal tax on prizes as large as the current jackpots. With additional taxes, you’ll see roughly 37% of your prize money withheld, should you win.&nbsp;</p><p>At best, according to an analysis of the current Mega Millions jackpot by&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>USA Mega</a>, a grand prize winner will get about $552.5 million with the annuitized payout (30 annual payments that gradually increase) or $260.5 million in cash. In states with lottery taxes, the actual payout would range from about $457.1 million in annuitized payments or $215.5 million in cash (in New York) to $530.6 million annuitized or $250.2 million in cash (in Arizona, where the state tax is 2.5%).</p><p>USA Mega also offers an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">analysis</a> of the Powerball jackpot.</p><p>Those payouts, considered estimates, could change if the jackpots grow or shrink, and if there are multiple jackpot-winning tickets.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Can I remain anonymous if I win Mega Millions or Powerball?</h3><p>If you’re lucky enough to win either jackpot, even if you aren’t the sole winner,&nbsp;<a href=#>experts recommend</a>&nbsp;moving quickly to assemble a team that includes an attorney, a tax advisor, and a financial advisor. They also encourage protecting your ticket and keeping your victory a secret for as long as possible.</p><a href=# class=promo-link__link>Not sure how to play Mega Millions? Here’s what you need to know</a><p>That may be easier in some states than others — only a select few&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">let winners of such large jackpots remain anonymous</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>When are the next Powerball, Mega Millions drawings?</h3><p>The next Powerball drawing will be held at 10:59 p.m. ET on Monday, March 18.</p><a href=# class=promo-link__link>Why have there been so many massive Powerball, Mega Millions jackpots recently?</a><p>Mega Millions players will have to wait until 11 p.m. ET on Tuesday, March 19 to find out if they’ve won.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What else should I know about Powerball and Mega Millions?</h3><p>Tickets for both games are $2 each.</p><p>Mega Millions tickets are sold in 45 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
