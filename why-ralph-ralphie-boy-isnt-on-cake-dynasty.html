The new series follows Buddy and his family as they manage their growing empire, which now far surpasses their brick and mortar store, while trying to stay true to their roots and maintain the cake shop that started it all. While there are plenty of familiar faces in the new series, there's one person who's missing. Immediately we found ourselves wondering: where is Ralphie Boy?!</p><img alt="buddy valastro's cake dynasty" title="Buddy Valastro's Cake Dynasty" width=952 height=1112 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2023-12-05-at-10-56-47-am-656f56584b71c.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">IMBD</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Though, Ralphie (Ralph Attanasia III) isn't officially a part of the Valastro family, he's been a part of the Cake Boss cast since the beginning of season 3 of Cake Boss in 2010. Ralph was the head of the sculpture department at Carlo's Bakery, utilizing his artistic background and talents to create some of the series' best <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/g2806/best-christmas-cakes/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="cake masterpieces" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">cake masterpieces</a>. He also appeared on other shows with Buddy including Buddy vs. Duff and Bake It Like Buddy. So, why isn't Ralph on Cake Dynasty?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">From Ralph's social media accounts, we pieced together that, after 12 years, he no longer works at Carlo's Bakery. On January 28, 2023, posted a tweet bashing his former job: "You should have seen people's faces at my new job when I told them that at my old job I went 3 years without a raise, twice, or that we never got a Christmas bonus in the 12 years I was there," Ralph wrote on Twitter.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The new job he is referring to is at a prop shop in New Jersey, he explained in the comments. Ralph's talent and presence will surely be missed on Buddy Valastro's Cake Dynasty. If you want to watch the new show, episodes drop every Saturday night at 10/9c and stream next day on A&E and Philo.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq e19xk9rq1"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/countryliving/static/images/logos/lettermark.db953ef.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Maggie Horton is the Associate News Editor at Country Living.
