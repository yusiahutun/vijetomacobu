Oh wow, my teeth just about fell out! This is great!”</p><a href=# class=promo-link__link>New species of sea snail, Cayo margarita, named with Jimmy Buffett in mind</a><p>On the title: James William Buffett of Key West, Florida — better known to friends, family, and a legion of fans as Jimmy Buffett, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post data-id=1672829>the beach music icon who died in September 2023</a>. Parrotheads can imagine that maybe he dreamed up some of his song lyrics cruising down Highway 1 in this classic.</p><p>“They really connect with him. They follow him around… Didn’t matter if you lived in Greensboro and he was in Charlotte, you were going to Charlotte to see him,” Ransom said. “I mean, they were just very loyal to him.”</p><p>The Falcon is unique, too. It’s got a roll bar, more common in a sports car, added by Buffett so the car could hold his surfboard.</p><p>Now, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.facebook.com/gaaclassiccars/posts/pfbid02TP8Gc2UUdHJZAdbiBznGuyqaZnYmiRtbYghYqAwDoc419umaXd29gVzYZPRA8Uh9l>after a winning bid of $258,500 price</a>, someone is walking away with the ultimate Parrothead prize. As a bonus, it comes with one of Buffett’s surfboards and a signed guitar.</p><p>“We’ve sold some million-dollar cars, and that’s been great. But for me to be able to sell a Jimmy Buffett car, still titled in Jimmy Buffett’s name, his guitar and surfboard goes along with it all in one package deal with the authenticity saying this is his signature on the guitar… It’s great. It’s a great day.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46nmK2hn6OurXnNnq6sZ5qeuq7FjJusn56VqcG0ecWoqZ1llpa5pLvNZqqepJyoeqe70WZpbnBlZX1urdNmmK6bpJ68r3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
