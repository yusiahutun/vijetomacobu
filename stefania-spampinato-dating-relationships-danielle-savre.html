Moreover, after Stefania Spampinato’s addition to the cast as OBGYN Carina DeLuca in season 3, and her marriage with Maya Bishop (Danielle Savre) the next season, the series surely has turned more romantic.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But is their romance real? If not, who is Stefania dating IRL? Scroll down to learn all about Stefania’s relationships.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Is Stefania Spampinato Dating Danielle Savre IRL?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Stefania Spampinato and Danielle Savre shared a deep connection on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Station 19</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. The two first met each other in season 3, and their relationship slowly progressed over time. But in ep 14 season 4, Stefania (Carina) was forced to pack for her trip back to Italy because her American Visa ran out, and Danielle (Maya), naturally, was upset about it.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And this was where their relationship took a new turn.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Over the ep, the two then shared their secrets. Although Carina shared that she didn’t believe in marriage, Maya insisted that moving in together was already a commitment equal to marriage. One thing led to another, and Carina went on to admit that she wanted to have children. Unfortunately, Maya did not.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, Carina refused Maya’s marriage proposal and made her way to the airport. On her way there, she then spoke to her ex in Italy, which then made her realize that she made a mistake. Thus, she turned around, found Maya, and told her that she wanted to marry her.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The couple then got married on the season’s finale.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Well, their on-screen romance is one thing, but the two even looked closer when they weren’t acting. A fan wrote, So yeah, after watching that IG live of @D_SAVRE and @spampistefania, im just out here wondering…why aren’t you guys dating??? Y’all are obvs attracted to each other????”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But Stefania Spampinato and Danielle Savre never publicly admitted that they were dating IRL.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Danielle didn’t seem like she was interested in women, given that she was dating Andrew Contis (a video analyst for the Chicago Blackhawks hockey team) in 2018. Reportedly, the two dated for over 4 years and were in a long-distance relationship for most of that time.</span></p><h3><b>Stefania Spampinato Relationships</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Stefania Spampinato is a private person.

In an interview with her on-screen girlfriend Danielle, the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Station 19</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> star one shared that she would love it if her date cooked for her.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, she then went on to add that, for her to go on a date with someone, she has to feel pretty strongly about them.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Someday, Stefania wants to fall in love at first sight with someone.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Back in early 2019, Stefania was spotted with her co-star Alberto Frezza at an event for </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Avengers: Endgame</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2019), and a few believed that the two were dating.
