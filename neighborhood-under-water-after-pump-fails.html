Marshall says that’s when maintenance told her the water pumps broke.<br>The entire morning, tow trucks have been hard at work.</p><p>“This year with the rain, this has been a lot of what we’ve done is recovering and pulling vehicles out of the water,” Addison Ryckeghen, owner of QC Auto Rescue. “You know, water that flashes up real quick.”&nbsp;</p><p>Ryckeghen says he’s pulled out at least four cars and is expecting more with waters creeping up.</p><p>“It’s about probably two foot of water.”</p><p>Marshall said the landlords didn’t notify residents. She had to make a call to find out what happened.</p><p>Another neighbor said they’ve been dealing with this issue&nbsp;for a couple days now.&nbsp;</p><p>“This flooding happens every single year, there has been no pumps going this whole week over here,” Chad Cooney said. “They said they had one going the other night but it quit working on them. Well, they’re moving cars, but they’re not fixing the pump which isn’t fixing the problem.”</p><p>One homeowner says maintenance is currently working on getting an engineer on site. Until then, many will remain surrounded by water.</p><p>Local 4 News has contacted the Falcon Farms leasing office regarding flood relief. We have not heard back.</p><p>Got a news tip?
