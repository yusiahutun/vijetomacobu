Additionally, conducting thorough online research to analyse historical flooding data can offer valuable information. Leveraging your network of friends and acquaintances to gather local insights about past flooding incidents can further enhance your understanding of the area's flood risk. By combining these methods, you can make a well-informed decision about the suitability of a location for your investment," Mburugu told <strong>TUKO.co.ke</strong> in an exclusive interview.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/142d30bc8347a215.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nairobi's Urban Plan Needs Serious Audit to Avoid Deaths Caused by Floods, City Politician</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The realtor further advised Kenyans to avoid purchasing property in flat-lying areas without proper drainage plans or in over-congested estates where infrastructure may be inadequate to handle water flow during heavy rains.</p><p class=align-left>He also emphasised the need to consult professionals such as surveyors and engineers on the drainage and other flood risk factors</p>"Seeking professional guidance is another essential step in making an informed decision. Consulting with a qualified surveyor, free from developer influence, is invaluable. A professional surveyor will advise against purchasing property in riparian areas prone to flooding. Furthermore, architects and engineers can assess the adequacy of drainage systems in both land and existing structures," Mburugu advised.<h2>Reactions from Kenyans</h2><p class=align-left>@JJonmwangi said:</p>"Weeeh!
