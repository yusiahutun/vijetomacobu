Sometimes your pan is too hot and pieces get too crispy, and other times they just feel rubbery and flat. But there’s a small tip that can make a big difference — and give you ultra-fluffy scrambled eggs.</p><p>This hack comes from Emerald Pellot at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">In The Know</a>. The next time you’re making scrambled eggs, instead of just quickly whisking them in a bowl with a fork, throw your eggs — along with a pinch of salt and pepper — in the blender and run it for 10 seconds or until it’s frothy. (And if you add milk or <a href=#>water to your eggs</a> before cooking, add them to your blender, too!) This will not only blend your eggs evenly, but it’ll also add some air bubbles to give them that extra fluffy texture when you cook them. If you want an appliance that’s a little lower maintenance, feel free to use an immersion blender to combine your eggs together.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>I eat eggs a couple of times a week and decided to test this one out using the small blender I have at home. I followed the steps of putting eggs, almond milk, and salt and pepper together and whipping them up, and sure enough, they came out looking super smooth when I cooked them in my pan. As the recipe promised, they were definitely fluffier than the eggs I’m used to cooking, and the texture was a bit airier without any rubberiness or clumps. And just as important, they tasted great! I also tried pulsing my blender several times as opposed to letting the blender just run for 10 straight seconds, but the results seemed to be the same. And maybe it was just in my head, but when I added cheese to my eggs in my pan, it looked like it spread more evenly and didn’t get into sticky clumps in the process.</p><p>While it may seem like an extra step, it’s definitely worth putting in the effort to <a href=#>up your scrambled egg game</a>!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonainlGK%2Fpq%2FIqZysZ6OYv6K5waWcnWWVnLS0ecGlnKeclad6qa3CpA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
