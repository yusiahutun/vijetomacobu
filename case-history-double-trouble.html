Although he was able to get back up, he told a teammate that it was the hardest hit he had ever received.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The impact left Lehe dizzy and unable to see clearly. But true to the macho code of football, he gritted his teeth, shook off the discomfort, and finished the game.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The next night, Lehe went to watch a college football game. But the following day, he complained of a severe headache and felt extremely tired. On Monday morning, he told his mother he wanted to see a doctor.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A computerised tomography (CT) scan showed that all appeared normal in Lehe's head. Nevertheless, the doctor told him to stop playing football until all his symptoms subsided.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But an important game was coming up. As team captain, Lehe was determined to set an example and get back on the field of play. Moreover, his CT scans were completely normal, meaning there was no evidence that anything was seriously wrong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The teenager did not tell his coach that he was still suffering the effects of Friday night's hit to the head.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite searing headaches and finding it difficult to concentrate, Lehe attended practice and participated in hitting drills - exercises where players run at each other at full speed with the intention of knocking the other player down.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After taking a few hits, Lehe stepped to the side and told a friend: "My head is killing me, and I can't feel my legs." He then collapsed in a seizure before falling into a deep coma.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lehe was rushed to a local hospital where CT scans showed small subdural haematomas, the pooling of blood on the surface of the brain. He was airlifted to the Goodman Campbell Brain and Spine Centre at Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Doctors there, including neurosurgeon Dr Michael Turner, found that the pressure inside his head was dangerously high. Normal levels should be between 5 and 15mmHg (millimetres of mercury). Lehe's brain was under a whopping 25 to 30mmHg of pressure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) scans showed that there were small blood clots, but they were not the cause of Lehe's problems. The real problem was cerebral swelling.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lehe was a victim of second impact syndrome (SIS) whereby his brain suffered another trauma before it had fully recovered from injuries caused by a first impact, leading to catastrophic - and often fatal - swelling of the brain.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">SIS is a relatively rare condition, with only 30 or so reported cases in the United States to date. But the mortality rate is extremely high at 90 per cent, says Turner.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The condition has only ever been reported in young athletes. Turner hypothesises that teenage brains are susceptible to SIS because they are still developing, and the immature brain responds differently than the mature one to trauma.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The initial impact probably affects the brain's ability to regulate the amount of blood reaching the organ, says Turner. When this cerebral autoregulation is impaired and a second jolt to the brain is delivered, the brain overreacts, causing the cerebral arteries to widen, enabling more blood to flood the brain, and therefore leading to massive cerebral swelling.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The swollen brain creates intense pressure inside the fixed confines of the skull. This pressure was so great in Lehe's case that it pushed his brain and upper spinal cord downwards, and damaged parts of his brain.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Turner and his team battled for the next 55 days to save Lehe's life. They used everything in their medical arsenal to bring down the cerebral swelling and intracranial pressure, while trying to balance his blood flow, volume and pressure; respiratory rate; oxygenation levels; and other vital functions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During this critical time, Lehe's body suffered hypotension (low blood pressure), renal failure, sepsis, pneumonia and even temporary cardiac arrest.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Lehe was finally stable enough to leave the intensive care unit, he faced disabling changes and a long road to recovery. Lehe was no longer able to walk or talk. He spent the next 43 days in rehabilitation before he could finally go home.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Six years later, Lehe still cannot walk without support. He has regained much of his speech, but struggles with his short-term memory.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Given the rarity of this condition and the resulting dearth of data, SIS is not well understood.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Medical experts had long thought that SIS was brought about by blood clots that form after the first impact, thereby causing headaches. However, Lehe's case was a particularly instructive one for medical researchers because the CT scan after his first hit was clean, which debunked this long-standing theory.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">More importantly, says Turner, it shows that a clean CT scan does not prevent one from a devastating syndrome, and does not clear a player to return to the game.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Instead, severe and persistent headaches, such as those suffered by Lehe, might be a better predictor of the dangers of SIS.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Double trouble</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLWmrcutn2iZoqm2pLjEaGhqa2NlgXl7wpqqnmWYnsC1u9GyZJ2npZe5pnnTq6aumpya</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
