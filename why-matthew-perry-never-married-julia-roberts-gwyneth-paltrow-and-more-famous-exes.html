When he was 18 years old, he began dating the late Carrie Fisher's half-sister, Tricia. Although the romance didn't last long, the couple would later reconcile, albeit briefly, in the 1990s, shortly after Matthew found worldwide fame in&nbsp;Friends. <strong>"She didn't abandon me, but old fears crept up, and I ended the relationship."</strong></p><p id=ehZBYDoJEtS data-wc=31>Matthew also dated the actress Yasmine Bleeth. Their romance was short-lived, but Chandler Bing's love of the star continued as he often made references to the Baywatch star in the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/251d29ac0d53-shutterstockeditorial12046521o.jpg><h2>Romance with Julia Roberts, 1995</h2><p id=e3vsPAfx9Bt data-wc=83>Around the time that Matthew became a household name, he began dating fellow actor Julia Roberts. The Chandler Bing star wrote self-deprecatingly in his memoir how he couldn't believe that Julia would want to date him. The pair met after she signed up for a guest star slot in the sitcom and Matthew noted how by the time the cast were filming the episode, The One With the Superbowl – in which Julia and Matthew's characters date – they were already an item.</p><p id=e8u_4BU70UR data-wc=44>But Matthew ended up calling time on the high profile relationship, explaining in his book that he was "constantly certain" she would break up with him. "Why would she not? I was not enough; I could never be enough; I was broken, bent, unloveable."</p><p id=erwIWqoCs1 data-wc=14><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Why Matthew Perry's death is even more devastating for famous ex Julia Roberts</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0cc3fe640871-julia-roberts-in-1990s.jpg><h2>Romance with Gwyneth Paltrow</h2><p id=ehf4Qx6nPzR data-wc=62>Oscar-winning actress <a class=hm-link href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> shared a <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>heartwarming tribute to Matthew on Instagram</a> in which she referred to their brief romance in the early 1990s. The star shared an image of Matthew alongside a caption which read in part: "I met Matthew Perry in 1993 at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts. We were both there for most of the summer doing plays.</p><p id=eMMATB6cFmw data-wc=117>"He was so funny and so sweet and so much fun to be with. We drove out to swim in creeks, had beers in the local college bar, kissed in a field of long grass. It was a magical summer. He had shot the pilot of Friends but it had not aired yet. He was nervous, hoping his big break was just around the corner. It was. We stayed friends for a while until we drifted apart, but I was always happy to see him when I did." Although the pair didn't date for long, Gwyneth did get a mention in his book when he wrote about how they enjoyed a "make out session in a closet."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a775aa226d6f-gwyneth-paltrow-1990s.jpg><h2>Matthew Perry and Jamie Tarses</h2><p id=eUmchgUqjwI data-wc=78>TV producer Jamie Tarses, who died in 2021, and Matthew dated for a number of years in the 1990s following Jamie's divorce from a fellow TV producer.
