Jerry and Rebecca have been married since 2007 and recently opened up about why they think their marriage has lasted longer than most in Hollywood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f450c037252a-rebecca-romijn-plunging-red-dress.jpg><p id=eVK9_OuIbh data-wc=29><strong>"I guess we just keep on laughing,"&nbsp;</strong>Rebecca told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">DailyMail.com</a>. "Keep it light. You have to lighten up about everything. You have to be able to move on quickly."</p><p id=eIU70vqF_lg data-wc=68>Jerry added that he tries to avoid conflict with his wife. "If there's an argument brewing, I try not to engage," he said. "I try to distance myself," The Talk star continued, before jokingly adding: <strong>"I run out of the house, I get out of there! I run out! If I think a fight is happening, I run! My wife is also a Scorpio. It's a different situation."</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3b5b59a97c13-rebecca-romijn-jerry-oconnell.jpg><p id=elcr8PLKX4S data-wc=42><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The couple live in Calabasas with their daughters and in a surprising twist, their neighbor is Rebecca's ex-husband, <strong>John Stamos</strong>. Jerry was quizzed on whether he and John had seen each after the Full House actor moved into the neighborhood in 2021.</p><p id=eFBWxC6bM1W data-wc=52><strong>"I have not, but I make sure that my hair is perfect every day just in case I do see him,"</strong> he said on&nbsp;Watch What Happens Live with Andy&nbsp;Cohen.

I probably won't run into him because I shop at sort of discount supermarkets in our area and there are some higher-end supermarkets that I'm sure he goes to."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cafd7d409aae-john-stamos-rebecca-romijn.jpg><p id=ec3GLjwJEA data-wc=60>Rebecca previously discussed the downfall of her marriage to John – which lasted from 1998 to 2005 – during an appearance on The Talk. "I have a lot of really fun memories," she told Jerry on the show. "I have a lot of fond memories of him. A lot of things about him that I miss. But yeah, it’s tricky.</p><p id=ebYQ_FJvuYvE data-wc=18>"It's a very hard decision to come to when you decide to end a marriage.
