He was in shock. He was frightened,” Yeung said of his split-second decision to race over and give Tuchel a hug.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/11/18b1ff7f-0e5e-4d9d-9d61-0ae8298fa1f4_2656c5e4.jpg data-fid=14294926 data-resolution=1 width=2000 height=1122 title="Keith Yeung walks away while Hugh Bowman is treated on the track at Sha Tin on Saturday." alt="Keith Yeung walks away while Hugh Bowman is treated on the track at Sha Tin on Saturday." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“I was going stay on the ground for a little bit, but then I saw the horse was there, so I just bounced up and ran straight to him. I was still in shock myself, but that was the first thing that came to my mind.”</p><p>It was Yeung’s third nasty fall this year – he missed more than seven weeks after suffering fractures to his C4, C5 and T2 vertebrae in March – and he admitted he was a little ginger after riding in the final three races.</p><p>“I’m a little bit sore now, but not too bad,” Yeung said. “The one thing I don’t do is give up. I felt fine. I was lucky again, and I’m very grateful.”</p><h4><strong>Wong ready for the Valley: Fownes</strong></h4><p>Caspar Fownes believes it’s time stewards granted his apprentice Ellis Wong Chi-wang permission to ride at Happy Valley.</p><p>Incoming apprentice jockeys must first acclimatise to the high-octane nature of Hong Kong racing at the more spacious Sha Tin before being allowed to ply their trade at the tight-turning city circuit.</p><p>By saluting aboard the Fownes-trained Kaholo Angel in the Class Four Panashop Handicap (1,200m) on Saturday, Wong landed his sixth Hong Kong win, and now he has had 59 rides at Sha Tin.</p><p>“I’m very happy for Ellis, and hopefully, we can get some more winners for him. I hope [they let him ride at Happy Valley], but it’s all depending on how [chief steward Marc van Gestel] sees it,” Fownes said.</p><p>“Hopefully, they’ll allow it, and if they do, I’ll get him on the right horses to give him a chance to rack up some wins. Once you go to the Valley, you get some more confidence, and you can really improve as a jockey. I think he’s ready – he’s pretty cool.</p><p>“I’m sure the other trainers will slowly start to realise the boy can ride and give him some more rides. At this stage, there aren’t many rides coming his way, but that doesn’t matter. They will come soon.”</p><p>Fownes praised Wong for his effort aboard Kaholo Angel, with the 22-year-old tracking a decent speed set by James Tak and Rubylot before unleashing his mount inside the final 400m.</p><p>“Ellis rode a lovely race – no panic, nice and easy just behind the speed until it was time to come through, and he did the job nicely,” Fownes said.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/11/8f751188-7167-4aab-a1d2-457f804b020f_cf209e32.jpg data-fid=14294928 data-resolution=1 width=2000 height=1537 title="Jockey Ellis Wong celebrates Kaholo Angel’s win with Caspar (left) and Ronan Fownes." alt="Jockey Ellis Wong celebrates Kaholo Angel’s win with Caspar (left) and Ronan Fownes." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“He’s still learning, and he’s improving. I think a little bit of rain today really helped him – the track is beautiful,” he added of Kaholo Angel, who finished two and a quarter lengths clear of runner-up Super Legends.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fownes welcomed the Jockey Club’s decision to extend the rating band of the all-weather Class Two over 1,200m on December 3 to accommodate horses rated 105-80, meaning Kurpany can line up on his mark of 102.</p><p>“It’s good. That race will be the plan with him. It’ll be good to get him back on the dirt,” Fownes said.</p><h4><strong>Kinross out of HKIR, Frankie unlikely</strong></h4><p>British speedster Kinross won’t be making the trip to Sha Tin for the Longines Hong Kong International Races (HKIR), but Australian star Mr Brightside remains a chance for December’s showcase meeting.</p><p>Hong Kong-owned Kinross was last seen running second behind Art Power in the Group One British Champions Sprint (1,200m) at Ascot last month.</p><p>Connections had long talked about a date with Golden Sixty in the Group One Hong Kong Mile. However, Jockey Club officials confirmed on Saturday that the two-time Group One winner would not be making the journey.</p><p>His superstar pilot, Frankie Dettori, also looks set to miss HKIR, with the Racing Post reporting the 52-year-old could be set for a stint in the Australian jungle as part of the British reality television show I’m A Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here!</p><p>As for Mr Brightside, Will Hayes told Australia’s racing.com he and his brothers, Ben and J.D., will see how their stable star pulls up from his second behind Pride Of Jenni in Saturday’s Group One Champions Mile at Flemington.</p><p>“He is our most precious asset. We will make sure he is A-1 if he does go to Hong Kong. There’s also the paddock because the autumn is pretty special as well – lots of prize money on offer,” Hayes said of the four-time Group One winner, who finished a nostril behind Hong Kong’s Romantic Warrior in last month’s Group One Cox Plate (2,040m).</p><p>Comments</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mq5mTnruoe8Crq6KbnJp8dH6TamlqaF%2BgsqrAx2awnq2enHqxwdOsZKGnoqiybrLIq6qtZZGbwaa%2BjKeYrKypYsCprYytoKdllpa5rXnIrWSbqpWWuLR5zLJkoZ2Rp8E%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
