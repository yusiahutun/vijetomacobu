When they went out to dinner with mutual friends, Rachel tried to start a conversation with Alex, but he was too shy to reciprocate. Rachel knew she wanted to get to know him better, so they began talking more and after a couple of months the two started dating.</p><p>HOW THEY KNEW THEY FOUND THE ONE: Alex says he noticed there was something different about Rachel. “I couldn’t get her out of my head,” he says. “I felt like I could always trust her and be happy with her by my side every day.” Rachel knew right away that Alex was the one. “I could be my truest self with him from the very beginning,” she says. “In Alex I have a partner who shares the same life goals as me, encourages me, makes me laugh, feel safe, and feel incredibly loved.”</p><p>ON THE PROPOSAL: Rachel had never been to Franklin Park Conservatory in Columbus, Ohio, and she wanted to see the holiday lights there. Once inside, the couple found a bench where they could have a moment alone. “We found this cute secluded bench that had tropical leaves and plants, which reminded me of Florida, where I grew up,” Rachel says. Alex could barely speak throughout the night because of his nerves. “Once we were all alone, I finally was able to speak words and ask her to marry me,” he says. He used the same phrasing to ask Rachel to be his wife as he did when he first asked her to be his girlfriend.</p><p>ON THE LOCATION: While the couple lives in Ohio, Rachel grew up in Stuart. When it came time to pick a ceremony site, they knew Snug Harbor Marina near her parents was the perfect spot. “The marina overlooks the river and provided such a cozy and personal environment to get married,” Rachel says. “For the reception… the views at The Mansion at Tuckahoe were stunning and we fell in love with that venue when we first walked around.”</p><p>ON THE THEME: The couple envisioned a simple, elegant, and romantic wedding, but they also knew they wanted to include a tropical touch. The bouquets, boutonnieres, and table decorations featured orchids and palm leaves with accents of tropical flowers. The food also had a tropical flair with selections such as coconut chicken with mango salsa, beef with chimichurri sauce, and coconut lime pineapple rice.</p><p>ON THE “FIRST TOUCH”: Alex wanted to keep with tradition, so the couple opted not to have a first look. Instead, before the ceremony, they stood back-to-back for a “first touch” to talk about their excitement and swap love notes.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/05/college_sweethearts.jpg alt width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>WEDDING DATE: May 26, 2019</p><p>CEREMONY: Snug Harbor Marina</p><p>RECEPTION: The Mansion at Tuckahoe</p><p>GOWN DESIGNER: Rebecca Ingram</p><p>EVENT PLANNER: Eventful Moments by Cindy Morley</p><p>FOOD: Bonner Bar and Catering<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/05/college_sweethearts_cake.jpg alt width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZMC1wcCrq2akmZuycLzEqKelnV%2BYvK24xKCcZqunmrK1tMSaqa2rXayypXnArWSspqWceqmt0Zumq2WplrCpwIyco66aXZ67br%2FTrpirrF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
