Because you have not been accepted by anyone the way you are.

Because you have not been accepted by anyone the way you are. They have created the fear and apprehension that if you accept yourself, everybody will reject you.</li><li>But to be what I am, to live what I was meant to live, to want to sound like no one else, to yield the blossoms dictated to my heart: this is what I want - and this surely cannot be arrogance.</li><li>I am tomorrow, or some future day, what I establish today. I am today what I established yesterday or some previous day.</li><li>God made me the way I am, and I accept myself. I am who I am, and I'm proud of myself.</li><li>You can’t let other people tell you who you are. You have to decide that for yourself.</li><li>I am somebody. I am me. And I don’t need anybody to make me somebody.</li><li>Love me without restriction, trust me without fear, want me without demand and accept me for who I am.</li><li>Love me without fear. Trust me without questioning. Need me without demanding. Want me without restrictions. Accept me without change. Love me for who I am.</li><li>I love to see the sun come smiling to the world; I love to hear the wind singing through a field; I love to listen to a lovebird singing in a tree, and I love to see a lovely face light up with love for me.</li><li>You know me so well inside out. Your deep acceptance of me is what I love most about you.</li><li>Generally, self-acceptance is conceptualized as an affirmation or acceptance of self despite weaknesses or deficiencies.</li><li>To accept ourselves is to accept that what we think, feel, and do are all expressions of the self when they occur.</li><li>Continually feeding our need for positive self-evaluation is a bit like stuffing ourselves with candy. First, we get a brief sugar high, then a crash.</li><li>Love me for who I am, not for who you want me to be.</li><li>The reason people find it hard to be happy is that they always see the past better than it was and the present worse than it is.</li><li>I have reached a point in my life where I feel it is no longer necessary to try and impress anyone. If they like me the way, I am, good. If they don't, it's their loss.</li><li>Take me or leave me; accept me or walk away; love me or hate me, but don’t make me feel less of a person if I don’t fit your idea of who I should be.</li><li>I am a persona of action; I'm immovable in my determination, confident in my abilities, unshakable in my convictions, impervious to doubt, insensitive to the negative opinion of everyone who does not have an interest in my goals.</li><li>I am who I am. Like me, love me. Take me, leave me. Know that I am a true friend to the end and ask for nothing in return except two things: don't hurt or use me.</li><li>Don't judge me by my past; I'm not in the post anymore. Accept me for who I am because this is me today.</li><li>Love me without restriction, trust me without fear, want me without demand and accept me for who I am.</li><li>I don't have a fantastic figure or flat stomach. I'm far from being considered a model, but I'm me. I eat food. I have curves. I have more fat than I should. I have scars because I have a history. Some people love me, some people like me, some hate me. I have done good. I have done bad. I love my pj's, and I go without makeup and sometimes don't get my hair done. I'm random and crazy. I don't pretend to be someone I'm not. I am who I am; you can love me or not. I will not change!! And if I love you, I do it with my heart! I make no apologies for the way I am.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/96c433f230bf95c3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ best romantic text messages that will make her want you</span></p></a><h2>Deep accept me as I am quotes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/08062b33df465861.jpg><p class=align-left>Of course, accept me for me quotes are profound, but what if you want to go deeper? For example, maybe you have gone through various <a href=#>quotes</a>, and they don't just hit home as you wanted.

I don't worry about anything that I can't control. That's a really good lesson in life.</li><li>Love yourself first, and everything else falls into line. You have to love yourself to get anything done in this world.</li><li>Love who you are, embrace who you are. Love yourself. When you love yourself, people can kind of pick up on that: they can see confidence, they can see self-esteem, and naturally, people gravitate towards you.</li><li>I am a positive person. I am not cynical. If you are born in this world, no matter who you are, negative things will happen. If you aren't positive as a person, you will be miserable. So, it's imperative to be positive, laugh, be happy, and accept life when it comes.</li><li>I am accepting of who I am and how diverse I am and honouring that.</li><li>Now I am older; I understand we have to accept who we are.</li><li>I am secure in who I am. I don't need the validation of those who say you have to be a specific thing to be accepted. So, I'm comfortable going against the grain if I need to.</li><li>It took me several years to figure out who I am and a few more to accept what I discovered. Now, I'm in the enjoyment stage of that process, and it's a happy place.</li><li>Don't judge me; you cannot handle half of what I have dealt with. There's a reason I do the things I do; there's a reason I am who I am.</li><li>I'm not interested in trying to work on people's perceptions. I am who I am, and if you don't take the time to learn about that, your perception will be your problem.</li><li>There are two ways to love yourself, the easy way and the hard way. If you choose to live the hard way, stop expecting anything at all. Don't get your hopes high, no matter how good you are. You'll get fu$%ed up every single time, and you have to accept it, get back up and try again. I am not saying this time you will get through. But you'll get fu%$d up over and over! That's what it is! It's life. Then come the easy way. It's how soon you realize that you have to learn it the hard way.</li><li>Accept me for who I am or leave me the way I am an actual image of God. I need no photoshop, and the core of who I am has no settings.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7196d6dd10a5cf42.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best true love quotes</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Among the above, accept me the way I am quotes; which one do you find the most inspiring?
