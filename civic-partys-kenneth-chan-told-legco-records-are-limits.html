"It looks like restrictive treatment and pays little regard to my right to information. It is not clear how the exempted categories are being interpreted. I would have expected some explanation in detail."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chan said he might lodge an appeal to Legco's committee on access to the legislature's document and records.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While not commenting specifically on the case, Legco assistant general secretary Matthew Loo said that if more details were given to explain a denial of access "the confidential contents â€¦ might be indirectly revealed".</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chan's application for an open record, titled "Sino-British Joint Liaison Group" and dated 1985, was granted, but the identity of the writer and the addressee were redacted by the Legco staff, who said the information was removed in line with the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The document was a draft memo written by someone in the now defunct Office of the Unofficial Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The writer noted that a lawmaker pointed out a discrepancy between the English and Chinese texts of the Joint Declaration's Annex II, arguing that under the Chinese text, the liaison group had the right to discuss constitutional reform pertaining to Legco elections.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The writer concluded: "Now it seems that the Joint Liaison Group could legitimately consider such matters in the 'second period'. I trust that this would be of interest to you and would leave it in your good hands."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chan found the removal of words annoying. "Without knowing the identities, I have no idea whether the contents are of any historical interest. The writer and the addressee were acting in their official capacity, and I wonder why it has to do with privacy."</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Lawmaker left frustrated over Legco records</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZomKusmZi5pnuQb3BxbWhlfKS11aKaZqiRp8G6v4yknKemlam1bq%2FHmqVmrJ%2BhsW64xKCaqGWimrCwvsOsZJqqlWK5qrnIrao%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
