With more than 1,700 locations around the world and over US$2 billion in annual sales, Panda Express has become many Americans’ first — and in some cases, only — exposure to Chinese food.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Andrea Cherng is highly aware of that position. As a second-generation Chinese-American, she feels a responsibility, perhaps more so than her parents, to publicly celebrate the family’s roots.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Authenticity is a concept that Panda Express has battled for its nearly four-decade history. Critics are quick to label it as inauthentic Chinese food because of its deep-fried, high-sugar offerings, but the restaurant group, technically speaking, is as Chinese as its roots can get.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Chinese food is the new haute cuisine of choice for America’s rich</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now, the second generation of Panda Express is focused on raising awareness of what it means to be Chinese, while keeping in mind the diversity of their massive audience.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Panda Express was started in 1983 by Cherng’s grandfather, Ming Tsai Cherng, who was born in Yangzhou, China, and trained at a Chinese culinary arts school in Taipei.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He later secured a job as a chef in Japan before moving to Los Angeles to start up the predecessor of Panda Express, Panda Inn, in the 1970s with his son, Andrew Cherng, and daughter-in-law Peggy Cherng.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/18/bf4c449a-d85b-11e9-80eb-3aa57b6d2433_1320x770_152833.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the time, the Los Angeles area was teeming with new Chinese immigrants, mostly from Taiwan and Hong Kong. Changes to immigration law in 1965 inspired East Asians to move in droves to the San Gabriel Valley, a suburban enclave of Los Angeles now famous for its Chinese food.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The new wave of immigrants shepherded a higher standard of Chinese food because unlike previous waves, these expats were generally more educated and wealthy. Competition became fierce.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Cherng family was a part of this movement. However, their restaurant, located in Pasadena, just north of the heart of the San Gabriel Valley, was frequented mostly by non-Asian clientele. To survive, they had to adapt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/18/cd8f4454-d85f-11e9-80eb-3aa57b6d2433_1320x770_152833.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Andrew Cherng, Ming Tsai Cherng’s son, wasn’t a purist when it came to food. He was opportunistic and studied the competition. When he saw that lobster and steak dinners were popular, he worked with his father, the head chef, on introducing their own interpretation to their customers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In the beginning, everything was already being translated by master chef Ming Tsai Cherng,” Andrea Cherng says. “And the way that he cooked always had that Chinese heritage.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The man who has dined at more than 7,300 Chinese restaurants in the US</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although they were adapting Chinese food for an American audience, the Cherngs were still influenced by the palate they developed in China. Personal taste, no matter the distance, could not be completely altered by immigration.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 1970s and 80s were instrumental in shaping the fabric of Chinese-American cuisine. General Tso’s chicken debuted in New York City in the 70s, and orange chicken was launched by Panda Express’ executive chef, Andy Kao, in 1987.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/18/199bfd42-d860-11e9-80eb-3aa57b6d2433_1320x770_152833.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They were survivalists’ dishes, plates that were crafted out of necessity in order to appeal to the non-Asian consumer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“These were the things that paved the way for all the culinary originality that we enjoy today,” Andrea Cherng says. “It’s what made it possible for so many families here to become established and introduce a non-Chinese population to Chinese flavours.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">San Francisco chef on getting Chinese-American cuisine taken seriously</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In many ways, the Cherngs’ ingenuity is a reflection of how Chinese food has evolved over time. After all, the phrase “Chinese food” is a nebulous catch-all for any food that Chinese people eat. Regional food in China, whether it’s in the north, south, east, or west, is shaped by local taste buds and ingredient availability. American Chinese cuisine is no exception.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Today, Andrea Cherng ensures that every dish that Panda Express rolls out has a Chinese story with it. The people she hires are highly educated in the cuisine’s history and intricacies, but they’re also flexible in their approach to food.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/18/57cf77f6-d860-11e9-80eb-3aa57b6d2433_1320x770_152833.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The American palate is much more diverse now,” says Jimmy Wang, the head chef at Panda Express. “Before, the mind-set was heavy, sweet and saucy. That isn’t the case anymore.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wang is no stranger to Chinese food. Born and raised in Taiwan, he moved to Los Angeles in his teens and went through classical training at the California School of Culinary Arts (now Le Cordon Bleu). Later, he learned about the technicalities of Chinese cuisine from his Burmese-Chinese father-in-law.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/18/330309ee-d859-11e9-80eb-3aa57b6d2433_1320x770_152833.png><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Both Wang and Cherng have an encyclopaedic knowledge of Chinese cuisine, and they are no strangers to regional distinctions. They are as knowledgeable about the nuanced flavours of Sichuanese cooking as they are about the historical origins of Jiangsu’s sugar-heavy dishes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s from this awareness that new dishes have been born. In fact, orange chicken, invented 30 years ago, was a riff off of a Sichuanese dish that’s usually served with lemon peel and spice. These subtleties might be lost to the average consumer, but they’re still very much there, and that makes Panda Express a conscious ambassador of Chinese cuisine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The first generation was about survival,” Cherng says. “The second generation is about heritage and individual expression. Not only do we get to shape the dialogue around food, but now, we get to shape the dialogue around culture.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmm6uhnqB8or7TopqlnV9ofXODk3BqaKukpL%2B6ecCmnKuhk5a7bq%2FHoqWeq5VisKmtyKdkqZmema5usdepqZ6ro2KwqbXNnqqeZZakvKV5yK0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
