She was discovered with the names of several people written on her body, including her sister April and ex-boyfriend.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her ex-boyfriend was a suspect in her death, after friends and family reported that their relationship was at times violent.

Their theory is that Holly was murdered and her body was staged to look like a suicide.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Holly's father Ray was one of the last to see her alive when the two had ice cream that night. He claims that he received text messages from the person he believes killed her.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Then there's a few messages that get sent out that are bad grammar and bad spelling â€“ unlike Holly,' Ray said told Denver Channel.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Then there's another 15-minute break, a couple of more messages, a 20-minute break, and then the last one that shows a picture of her leg with the handwriting on it.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Holly's mother Shelly has since passed away due to complications from MS. When Holly was alive, she was a full-time caretaker for her mother.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, it was James A. Wilkerson IV, M.D., who conducted the autopsy on Holly the day after she passed, and he ruled her death a suicide. He is the chief coroner at Larimer County, but was working in Douglas County that day.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The family also pointed to some aspects of the crime scene that they felt made her death suspicious. X-rays showed that Holly had a broken collar bone post-mortem, her hand was found tangled in the cord used to hang herself, and the way the cord was fashioned was not consistent with a hanging suicide.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The private investigators hired by the family, Drs Richard and Selma Eikelenboom-Schieveld, have both had substantial experience working in forensic science, including the cases of&nbsp;Jon Benet-Ramsey and Peggy Hettrick.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As was the case for Hettrick, they believe they could overturn the authorities' decision based off of DNA evidence. They collected a number of swabs from the scene which they are encouraging the family to have processed.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The DNA testing, however, costs a significant amount of money, and the family has tried to raise it by selling their house.</p><img id=i-9d73e7468414080b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/03/04/14/3DF27CEF00000578-0-image-a-13_1488638017093.jpg height=811 width=634 alt="X-rays showed that Holly had a broken collar bone post-mortem, which Wilkerson said was due to his autopsy&nbsp;" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>X-rays showed that Holly had a broken collar bone post-mortem, which Wilkerson said was due to his autopsy&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Wilkerson said that it's important to take all of the aspects of the case into account, but that the evidence in his opinion still pointed to a self-inflicted death.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said: 'What do I have to gain by calling this a suicide if it's not a suicide?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>&nbsp;'I mean, I'm looking for the truth, and if somebody did this, then I'm looking to get [the family] justice. But I think that Holly did it herself, and it's a tragedy.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Wilkerson said that it was his responsibility that Holly's collarbone was broken - as is a typical procedure when conducting an autopsy. Medical examiners cut through the bone during the process, as well as the ribs and clavicles.&nbsp;</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/03/04/14/3DF283FB00000578-0-image-m-32_1488636021838.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Mother and teenage daughter squatting in abandoned Melbourne...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/03/03/05/3DE727D900000578-0-image-m-59_1488518287167.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Muslim teen who was found hanged from a 'very high tree...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span><p class=mol-para-with-font>As the cord was wrapped around her neck several times, he said it was likely that&nbsp;her hand got caught beneath the cord by accident.
