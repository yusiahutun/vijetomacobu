It’s a pointed way to comment on the seemingly endless discourse on the Euphoria actress’ breasts (this piece included), which reached a fever pitch recently, when they were dubbed “double-D harbingers of the death of woke” by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://nationalpost.com/opinion/amy-hamm-wokeness-is-no-match-for-sydney-sweeneys-undeniable-beauty?taid=65e8c5e099a0eb0001ffe928&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The National Post" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>The National Post</u></a> and celebrated for being the reason that “boobs are back!” by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/boobs-are-back-thank-you-sydney-sweeney/?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1709711300-2" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Spectator" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>The Spectator</u></a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The latter two observations were prompted by Sweeney’s recent appearance on Saturday Night Live, with one sketch in particular casting her as a Hooters waitress earning $30,000 in tips. The fact that her hosting of the show was supposed to poke fun at this fascination seems to have been lost on her target audience, who one suspects have a similar understanding of nuance to a teenage boy typing “8008135” on a calculator to read “boobies”.<br></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Sydney Sweeney: Inside my beauty bag" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-imbb-sydney-sweeney-1-651e9aca25f8d.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The objectification of women in Hollywood is nothing new. Yet something that is striking about the conversation around Sweeney is just how much significance is being placed upon her breasts. It’s not simply that they’re lovely, in the vein of Chandler and Joey watching Yasmin Bleeth in slow-mo on Baywatch, or Roger Rabbit’s exaggerated mouth drop at Jessica Rabbit’s curves. Sweeney’s double-Ds have been granted Helen of Troy status – the right wing is willing to fight for them and their power to eradicate liberal nonsense.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Within society at large, having a more generous cup size is often stereotyped as more “womanly” and therefore makes you a more motherly mother and wifely wife, if you can follow the maths. Online, left-wing women who are trolled on X are often targeted for their breasts, with favourite insults being “flat-chested” or “unfuckable”. It’s why one of Marianne’s bullies in Normal People calls her an “ugly, flat-chested bitch”. To have small breasts is to be unwomanly and thus unloveable, and also, somehow, woke. The right wing in particular value traditional conservative gender roles more than any other political ideology, and Sweeney, with her blonde hair, bubbly persona and ample chest represents a narrow, idealised version of womanhood. Crucially, it’s also one that they haven’t felt “allowed” to express a preference for in recent years, because of, you’ve guessed it, woke culture. Therefore, her boobs are powerful to them.</p><img alt="saturday night live episode 1857 pictured host sydney sweeney during the monologue on saturday, march 2, 2024 photo by will heathnbc via getty images" title="Saturday Night Live - Season 49" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2049055485-6629056f381d6.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">NBC</span><p>Sweeney presenting ’Saturday Night Live’</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Not since Kim Kardashian’s posterior has so much focus been placed on one body part and its meaning. When it came to Kim K, her curves were proof that the “heroin chic” look (modelled by Kate Moss et al) was dead, and instead a different impossible aesthetic was “in”. To lesser extent, it was seen with Kylie Jenner’s lips, which were heralded as the reason for an increase in fillers in young women, or so-called “Instagram face” – a phenomenon whereby Gen Zers online all look startlingly similar. There’s also been Emily Ratajkowski’s “ab crack” and Cara Delevingne’s “thigh gap” (which was also dubbed a “harbinger of the apocalypse” by a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/nov/04/thigh-gap-obsession-most-extreme data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Guardian class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Guardian</u></a> reader in 2013). Each was blamed for prompting copy-cats, with their body parts condensed into a “trend”. Yet boobs are not “back” and bodies are not fashion trends.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A study published in 2012 in the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.1890 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="European Journal of Social Psychology" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>European Journal of Social Psychology</u></a> proved once and for all that our brains see men as whole and women as parts. A test group were shown a selection of images of men and women, before being shown the same pictures again, albeit with one “sexualised” feature exaggerated. Almost universally, the men were only recognised by their whole body, whereas the women could be identified by just their hips or breasts. “Everyday, ordinary women are being reduced to their sexual body parts,” wrote the study’s author Sarah Gervais, a University of Nebraska psychologist. “This isn’t just something that supermodels or porn stars have to deal with.” And what’s more, it’s not just men doing it, either, women objectify women too. Case in point: the writers of both The Spectator and The National Post pieces were both women.</p><img alt="sydney sweeney" title="Sydney Sweeney " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/episode-1889-pictured-actress-sydney-sweeney-arrives-on-news-photo-1702550474.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">NBC</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One of the questions that Sweeney is asked most often in interviews is, “are you a feminist?” There’s an assumption that a hot blonde with a great rack can’t possibly be intelligent, or political. Her belief system must correlate with a demographic that places the utmost importance on her “all American” looks. Or worse – that the very act of having a bodacious bod – and being proud of it – makes you in some way anti-feminist. That was certainly the line of argument when she starred in the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a45031069/sydney-sweeney-rolling-stones/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stones Angry music video" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Rolling Stones Angry music video</a> last September, rocking a leather corset and trousers, with some corners of the internet appalled that she would “objectify herself” in that way. The very act of objectification implies dehumanisation. And can you ever really objectify yourself? It’s an argument that came up earlier this year when the singer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a46361220/fka-twigs-calvin-klein-advert-banned/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="FKA twigs argued she did not recognise the “traditional sexualised object”" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">FKA twigs argued she did not recognise the “traditional sexualised object”</a> that the Advertising Standards Agency had reduced her to.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The biggest misconception about me is that I’m a dumb blonde with big tits,” Sweeney shared in an interview with Glamour magazine last year. We’d caveat that with another truism. “Some people think having large breasts makes a woman stupid. Actually, it’s quite the opposite: a woman having large breasts makes men stupid.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSwtrjTrqmeZZ6axLR7wG9nbnFgaX16e9Kym6edqWLAuLHEp5yyZZKksbp5wqikpp2eqXqwvMinoKimo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
