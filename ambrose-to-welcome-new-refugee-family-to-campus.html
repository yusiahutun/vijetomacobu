Its founder Diya Adbo, Ph.D., believes in a radical reimagination of higher education and campus life, according to a Wednesday release from St. Ambrose.</p><p>“A campus is organically well-suited to be a physical place of refuge in times of crisis,” Abdo said in the release. “A campus has everything necessary to function like a small city. We have housing, cafeterias, clinics, and plenty of human resources and connections to provide financial, social, and cultural support.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/08/ECAR.jpg><p>ECAR’s&nbsp;mission is to make every U.S. college and university a Resettlement Campus that can host refugees on campus grounds and support their successful integration.</p><p>In response to Pope Francis’ call on every European parish to host one refugee family, ECAR was founded by Dr. Diya Abdo in September 2015 to call on every college and university in the world to partner with their local refugee resettlement agencies to house refugees on campus grounds and assist them in resettlement, according to the ECAR website.</p><p>“At St. Ambrose, we are committed to living out our commitment to social justice in tangible ways, which add value to the education of our students,” Nicky Gant, St. Ambrose Service & Justice Coordinator, said Wednesday by e-mail. “The ECAR program will allow us to house and provide support to a vulnerable family, while providing valuable opportunities for faculty, staff and students to learn by being of service to the family and becoming more aware of the&nbsp;global refugee crisis.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2022/09/SAU-statue.jpg><p>“It’s been very exciting to see a large number of faculty, staff, and students, who wish to engage in this process of welcoming a vulnerable family and raising awareness of the refugee crisis here on campus,” she said. “While we work to serve this family, there will be many opportunities for us to learn, grow, and live out our Ambrosian values as a campus community. I hope our participation in the ECAR program will educate and inspire students to live out these values as they graduate and go out into the world.”</p><p><strong>An Ambrose welcome</strong></p><p>The refugee family (who will live on campus at no charge) will benefit from receiving a warm welcome from the SAU campus community “because opportunities to build connections with Americans creates conditions for long-term success in resettlement,” Gant said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/08/Gant.png><p>“On campus, the family will receive access to volunteer support with ESL and tutoring for example, along with safe shelter,” she said. “They will also receive access to our library, sports games, theater performances, art galleries, community events, counseling center and chapel in addition to possible&nbsp;job opportunities and childcare.</p><h2 class=inline-related-stories__heading>4 MORE</h2><ul class=inline-related-stories__list><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="They fled Syria’s shattering civil war.
