If your cat or dog is an attention seeker or comes with a demanding personality, you may want to listen up: One pet tech brand wants to make your life a little bit easier with its <a href=# rel=nofollow>automatic water bowl</a> that delivers fresh, clean water to cats and smaller dogs without you lifting a finger.</span></p><p><span>Petlibro’s offerings have already gone viral on TikTok, with pet owners praising the genius design of the brand’s OG <a href=# rel=nofollow>Capsule Water Fountain</a>. It holds enough water to ground itself securely, A.KA. you can worry less about spills or your pet knocking the entire bowl over daily.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg> <a title=@indooroutdoorkat href=# rel=nofollow>@indooroutdoorkat</a><p>Use code Kat15 for that 15% off! ✨bit.ly/3bxDw4Z✨ (link in bio as well) @petlibro <a title=petlibro href=# rel=nofollow>#petlibro</a> <a title=cathacks href=# rel=nofollow>#cathacks</a> <a title=catmom href=# rel=nofollow>#catmom</a> <a title=sponsored href=# rel=nofollow>#sponsored</a></p><p><a title="♬ Monkeys Spinning Monkeys - Kevin MacLeod & Kevin The Monkey" href=# rel=nofollow>♬ Monkeys Spinning Monkeys – Kevin MacLeod & Kevin The Monkey</a></p><p><span>There are quite a few pet water fountains available across the Internet, but Petlibro’s seems much more high-tech in my opinion. The constant stream of water (it can also gently bubble, depending on what your pet likes better) signals to your cat that it’s safe to drink and readily available 24/7. Plus, the model <a href=# rel=nofollow>comes with a 5-filter system</a> to bring the purest water possible to your pet. But perhaps most intriguing to owners, the fountain is “startling quiet” and doesn’t require constant refills; simply keep an eye on the bowl’s water level (it holds 2.1 liters) and add more as needed.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/petlibro-water-fountain.jpg><h2>Petlibro <span>Capsule Water Fountain</span></h2><p><span>The original <a href=# rel=nofollow>Capsule Water Fountain</a> boasts tons of glowing reviews from people who’ve already introduced it to their <a href=# id=auto-tag_pets data-tag=pets>pets</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As one person shared, “I got the water fountain a few days ago and let me tell you, it was instantly a hit for my baby boy! He was sitting there for at least ten minutes watching it, playing with it, and drinking from it! I noticed that he’s drinking a lot more water than he usually would with his last fountain. It was also super easy to put together AND the transparency of the capsule makes it simple to check the level of the water so I know he’ll never get close to running out.”</span></p><p><a href=#><b>RELATED: 6 Dog Fashion Trends in 2023: Barbiecore, Balletcore & More</b></a></p><p><span>Petlibro has since introduced more upgraded options like the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Dockstream Wireless Pump Water Fountain</a>. It has a 2.5-liter tank (slightly larger than its predecessor) which is detachable which makes refilling and cleaning easier. It also comes with a low water detection feature that halts the pump when the water tank dips below a safe level to prevent overheating.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/petlibro-dockstream.jpg><h2>Petlibro Dockstream Wireless Pump Water Fountain</h2><p><span>The <a href=# rel=nofollow>Dockstream Battery-Operated Water Fountain</a> may suit your needs better, due to its cordless design that allows you to place it all across your home (including outside) without the need for an outlet.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/petlibro-battery-system-copy.jpg><h2><span>Dockstream Battery-Operated Water Fountain</span></h2><p><span>All the models boast a “whisper quiet” feature, so you could in theory place the fountain next to your bed or by your desk without added annoyance (or your pet drinking out of your own water cup).</span></p><p><span>If I had a cat, I’d surely get one of these, especially since all of the above is 12 percent off for National Pet Day with the code <strong>PETDAY12.</strong></span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ShoppingNewsletter_onsitegraphic.png alt="StyleCaster Shopping Newsletter Sign Up" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8uinZ6rpK65pnuQbG1ucGZlfLGx06Wgm6qfYq62wM6mmK2hk2KzsMHNrZiipl8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
