The type of mousse you select really depends on which type of curls you have.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Identifying your curl pattern is crucial to choosing a curl mousse that won’t weigh down or dry out your hair. “Try to identify what type of curl you have, whether it's loose, tight, slightly straight, etc., and the type of texture your curl presents; soft, rough, frizzy, dry, etc.,” explains Chris Lospalutto, a hairstylist at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>SDSH Salon</a>. “This will help you to streamline and pinpoint exactly which mousse is right for your exact hair.” If you are unsure or have a combo of some of these, it never hurts to consult with your stylist to help put you in the right direction.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When on the hunt for a mousse for curly hair, you want to look for formulas that offer hydration. Curls that lack hydration oftentimes will look dull, frizzy, and lifeless. “Hydration gives curls the elasticity and shine needed to move and bounce with life,” explains Nyree Syphrett, a master hairstylist at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Warren Tricomi NYC</a>. “Also consider a product with more of a lightweight feel, as heavier products tend to leave the hair feeling oily and weighed down, making them lack movement and look less defined the next day.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Read on to find the best mousses for curly hair that hold up against heat and humidity, and deliver soft, bouncy, and voluminous coils.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hair-mousse-overall-virtue-curl-defining-whip></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hair Mousse Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Virtue Curl-Defining Whip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Virtue Curl-Defining Whip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZHI1M85L83Yo0XBxvW0vrhbSOks=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/virtue-curl-defining-whip-ca1708460c1a49939e33ddcc6f590d59.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Violet Grey</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This innovative brand is using new technology to repair dry, damaged hair while styling.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Several online reviewers note issues with the dispensing nozzle, though it worked fine for us.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Virtue is one haircare brand that should be on everyone’s radar. Celebrities, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Garner</a>, swear by the products because of the proprietary ingredient Alpha Keratin 60ku: A specialized protein that's naturally found in our hair and works to repair damaged strands. Though there is so much to love from the line, the Curl-Defining Whip does wonders for curly hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The luxurious whipped formula hydrates, smoothes, and de-frizzes (even in heat and humidity) on a surface level, while contributing to hair’s overall, long-term health from the root. It has a lightweight, non-sticky feel that won’t leave strands with that dreaded crunchy texture, creating bouncy and shiny curls. Plus, we think the scent is divine (peppery grapefruit with notes of driftwood).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We use this almost every wash day and are consistently impressed with how defined our ringlets look — and we love how long the bottle lasts. Some online reviewers have mentioned that the nozzle gets jammed after a few weeks (which is something to keep in mind), but we haven’t experienced any issues after months of use.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5.5 oz | <strong>Scented:</strong> Yes | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> Wavy and curly</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-ogx-locking--coconut-curls-decadent-creamy-mousse></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>OGX Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="OGX Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vcrN3gFY9Dsi7qr3k6iF5CwoZEc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ogx-locking-coconut-curls-decadent-creamy-mousse-163d6692443a4d27825a7d0880bb95f8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The lightweight formula beautifully defines curls and gives hair an impressive volume boost.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>This product contains silicones, which can cause product build-up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We were immediately intrigued by this innovative formula, which the brand bills as “part cream, part foam.” When you first dispense the mousse into your hands, the consistency feels thin and liquidy, but as you work it into your strands, it begins to expand and emulsify into a creamy texture that creates beautiful volume. A little goes a long way here!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Coming in at under $15, this product gives you a lot of bang for your buck — providing long-lasting moisture, frizz-control, and curl definition to wavy and curly manes. Though, keep in mind that silicones are included on this ingredient list, which can contribute to product build-up — so be sure you’re using a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>clarifying shampoo</a> once a week to really deep clean your scalp.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 7.9 oz&nbsp;| <strong>Scented:</strong> Yes | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> Wavy and curly</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-krastase-densifique-leave-in-thickening-mousse></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kérastase Densifique Leave-In Thickening Mousse</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="K&amp;eacute;rastase Densifique Leave-In Thickening Mousse" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lv1wEXNMt3omXysFrANKT579N44=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/krastase-densifique-bodifying-mousse-352277c0a440487e86ef9763f2abeb2c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This mousse is a leave-in formula that adds density and volume to fine or thinning hair.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The fragrance may be too strong for some.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Kérastase product may be pricey, but it’s so much more than just a typical mousse. It’s a leave-in formula that almost acts like a reparative mask and a styling product in one. Ingredients include hyaluronic acid and ceramides to actually strengthen and thicken hair follicles, preventing further damage and promoting new growth. Whether you just have fine curls or your hair has been thinning for a number of reasons like age, stress, or postpartum, this product actually works to add volume and density. Although, if you’re sensitive to scent, be warmed that this one is on the stronger side.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5.1 oz | <strong>Scented:</strong> Yes | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> Fine Straight, Wavy, Curly</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-fine-curly-hair-oribe-curl-shaping-mousse></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Fine Curly Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Oribe Curl Shaping Mousse</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Oribe Curl Shaping Mousse" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-2wbbYSQvkreB4QwCfPab-2u9O0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/oribe-curl-shaping-mousse-636a78b1b0a54641a2249b6a4aa5c324.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermstore</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Beyond moisturizing and defining waves and curls, it also works as a heat-protectant.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>While this mousse is ideal for&nbsp;wavy hair or very fine curls, we don’t recommend it for those with thick hair or tight curl patterns.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking to enhance your loose waves with mega volume and long-lasting hold, look no further than this Oribe Shaping Mousse. This product <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>performs best on fine hair</a> (often the most difficult texture to hold a curl!), offering shape and body with a lightweight, non-crunchy feel to make the loose waves of your dreams.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Featuring amino acids, strengthening proteins, and sweet almond oil (plus, a subtle jasmine and sandalwood infused scent), it nourishes strands while creating a protective barrier against heat. Though we don’t believe this is a true “curly” hair product (we don’t recommend it for those with 3 or 4 level curls), it made the list because it can create bouncy, shiny curls for those who’ve always wanted them.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5.7 oz | <strong>Scented:</strong> Yes | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> Wavy</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-sheamoisture-coconut--hibiscus-frizz-free-curl-mousse></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl Mousse</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SheaMoisture Coconut &amp;amp; Hibiscus Frizz-Free Curl Mousse" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/af_1cUAs-t7nebNeP4n8zdYW3rw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sheamoisture-coconut--hibiscus-frizz-free-curl-mousse-3721f8ee7dc144cc99d0af45d2e27da8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This mousse feels super lightweight, while still providing necessary hold for up to 3C curls.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>While the brand specializes in curls and tight textures, this mousse isn’t strong enough for 4A—4C hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">All curly girls will know that Shea Moisture is one of our absolute favorite go-to brands, and we love that their products can be picked up during your regular drugstore or Target runs. They use high-quality ingredients, with dreamy scents and effective results that protect natural curls and lengthen the life of your wash. This mousse provides a frizz-free hold with a super lightweight feel (which is very hard to find), and works incredibly well for curls in the C level. It’s perfect for air-drying, leaving your hair exceedingly soft and volumized with no icky residue or flakiness. Just wash, apply, scrunch, and you’re good to go!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 7.5 oz&nbsp;| <strong>Scented:</strong> Yes | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> Wavy & Curly</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-thick-curly-hair-ouidad-vitalcurl--weightless-curl-defining-mousse></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Thick Curly Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ouidad VitalCurl + Weightless Curl Defining Mousse</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ouidad VitalCurl + Weightless Curl Defining Mousse" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/eFKpECIdEbJUBVuh4ss9rTOe5xI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ouidad-vitalcurl---weightless-curl-defining-mousse-31ebd627d70f4942b7d2385b6dc1b43e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This mousse will bring dry, damaged curls back to life.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>If you have fine hair, this formula will feel far too greasy for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ouidad Weightless Curl Defining Mousse lives up to its name — it defines curls and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>protects against frizz</a> with an impressively soft and lightweight feel. Its frizz-control can withstand the heat, whether you live in a humid climate or cherish your diffuser.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We recommend this product for thick hair because its ingredients (like Japanese camellia and sunflower oils) specifically target dryness and stretched-out curls in need of revitalization for a return to moisturized, bouncy goodness. And though the formula excellently works its way through thick strands, it will feel too oily and greasy for those with finer hair.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5.7 oz | <strong>Scented:</strong> Yes | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> Thick and curly</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-wavy-curly-hair-rco-chiffon-styling-mousse></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Wavy-Curly Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>R+Co Styling Mousse</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="R+Co Chiffon Styling Mousse" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XJ0JJl5j5Fd4c2Tb-fmkxsiiA7c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/r-co-chiffon-styling-mousse-8e628752721c41b88b12c69b76717251.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>R+Co</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This mousse creates effortless beachy waves — without the need for hot tools.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Because it provides very light hold, it won’t work well for those with level three or four curls.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This lightweight mousse is ideal for those with wavy hair — its soft hold won’t weigh your strands down, but it still provides volume and long-lasting definition. For the perfect, sought-after beach waves, apply the mousse, scrunch hair from the bottom up to the roots, and let it air-dry for a look that's both structured and free-flowing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With high-quality naturally-derived ingredients like abyssinian oil and Black Polynesian volcanic sand, the formula provides deep nourishment, styling prowess, and protection from heat and color damage. Enhance your waves without the stiffness and crunch typically associated with curl-specific products, and enjoy the delectable scent which features notes of juniper berries, blood orange, and rhubarb. Keep in mind that because it provides very light hold it probably won’t be strong enough to tame and define type three or four curls — it’s definitely best reserved for those with looser curl patterns.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5.6 oz | <strong>Scented:</strong> Yes | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> Wavy</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-frizzy-hair-not-your-mothers-curl-talk-activating-mousse></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Frizzy Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Activating Mousse</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Not Your Mother&amp;rsquo;s Curl Talk Activating Mousse" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tp0SsSKoDm8JjvFsFY-CqIe46Uc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/not-your-mothers-curl-talk-activating-mousse-1104eb968f534568946f3a339c0c37c8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Heading somewhere humid?

This pick is it. Not Your Mother’s Curl Activation Mousse defines and enhances curls while providing heat-tested and long-lasting anti-frizz benefits. For the best results, apply the product to wet hair (the wetter, the better!) and let it air-dry or use a diffuser. You’ll see overall enhanced volume, but individual curls that are shapely and defined. It won’t have the softest feel compared to other formulas on this list, but that’s the price to pay for heavy-duty frizz-control. Your hair will retain bounce and shine even in tropical climates — as long as you don’t use too much product. Anything more than a small dollop can leave you with sticky strands.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 7 oz | <strong>Scented:</strong> Yes | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> Curly and coily</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-air-drying-pattern-curl-mousse></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Air-Drying</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pattern Curl Mousse</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pattern Curl Mousse" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7sSuRiOC1pSKQ_tZJARcvm1BlhQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pattern-curl-mousse-255b00afa9a64f9393d7b278a2c71b33.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It works great for loose curls and protective styles alike.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>This product performs best alongside a leave-in conditioner or other moisture-rich styling product.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re big fans of most products in the Pattern Beauty lineup (what can we say, Tracee Ellis Ross knows what she's doing), and the brand’s Curl Mousse exceeded our expectations.

Syphrett likes this option for people with dry hair for multiple reasons. “This product gives you vavavoom curls—full, plump, voluminous curls that won’t get affected by the humidity and turn frizzy,” she says. “It’s great for people with dry curls that need hydration.

That said, different mousses will provide differing levels of holds and definition. For those with looser curl patterns and wavy hair, opt for a very light mousse like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">R+Co Chiffon Styling Mousse</a>.

It’s quite versatile and works well alongside gels and curl creams to create bold impact and long-lasting results. “Mousse will provide a strong hold to help maintain a tighter curl pattern and maximum volume,” explains Kaleel. “Plus, it encases the hair and therefore holds moisturizing [ingredients] in the hair for longer periods of time, keeping your curls healthy,” she says. “Mousse is the best product to define curls with long-lasting hold,” adds LA-based celebrity hairstylist Dimitris Giannetos.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Does mousse leave your hair feeling sticky or crunchy?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It can — if you don’t select the right product for your hair type or if you apply too much. For fine hair or looser waves, be sure to look for an ultra lightweight formula that won’t weigh down your strands. The goal with mousse is to create a voluminous and bouncy curl. If applied correctly, the products listed above shouldn’t leave you feeling sticky or crunchy.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is mousse or gel better for curly hair?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They achieve different effects, but can also be used together. Typically, gel provides a stronger hold, while mousse creates shape and body. “Gel can make your hair look stiff and crunchy, where mousse is soft on the hair,” explains Giannetos.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Personally, I like to use mousse as a styling base and finish it off with a touch of gel (always mixed with water) to ensure maximum frizz-control. An extra tip? “If diffused until fully dry, a lot of times, the curl cast created by mousse will turn soft, leaving you with light and airy curls,” says Kaleel.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I use hair mousse?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Kaleel, it’s best to apply mousse on wet hair. She advises starting with a leave-in conditioner, styling with a Denman or other similar brush, and then scrunching in your mousse, fully coating the hair from the roots to the ends. She finishes by using the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>plopping method</a> with a microfiber towel. And if you opt for the diffuser, Giannetos says, “Half way through drying, use a little extra mousse for a better hold.”&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Daley Quinn</a> is a freelance writer, specializing in beauty and health, who has contributed to numerous publications, such as Elle, Real Simple, Allure, The Cut, WWD, and more.
