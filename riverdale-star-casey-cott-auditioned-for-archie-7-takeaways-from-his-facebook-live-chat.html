Cott chatted live from his humble New York abode about his favorite episode this season, which coincidentally (or not) aired Thursday, March 9 following his Facebook Live.</p><p>TooFab's Madison Brodsky joined Cott's live chat and here are the 7 things we learned.</p><h2 class=h2>'Riverdale' Auditions: He First Read for Archie and Jughead Roles</h2><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Cott actually auditioned for Archie first and then came back to audition for Jughead. But you know how the saying goes – “third times a charm” so the young actor then realized he should really be auditioning for Kevin.</p><p>Cott auditioned and got casted as Kevin, aka everyone's best gay friend on March 9 2016 so his Facebook Live was his audition and casting anniversary.</p><p>“A year ago it was Wednesday so then on Thursday I flew to Vancouver and on Friday I met the cast,” he said.</p><h2 class=h2>Casey Cott vs. Kevin Keller - What do they have in common?</h2><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Well, for starters they both start their first and last name with the same letter.</p><p>But what did Cott think?</p><p>“Kevin and I both try to spread joy in this world.”</p><h2 class=h2>On Cast Chemistry</h2><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>It's clear through the "Riverdale" cast's social media posts, inside jokes and vacations that they've clearly bonded. Cott feels very fortunate to work with such an amazing group of actors everyday.</p><p>“We talk regularly about how lucky we are that we have a group who loves each other. We have fun off set, which make us have fun on set. I miss them because they're all in LA right now and I'm in New York.”</p><h2 class=h2>Why He Wants Kevin to Have Pop's Milkshake With Luke Perry</h2><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Out of all the characters on the show, whom would Casey want to share a milkshake with? His first pick is Mr. Andrews, who is played by “90210” alum Luke Perry.</p><p>“He's so wise in the way he deals with all the drama and he gives great advice to Archie. Plus, Luke Perry is even cooler than his character. He defines cool.”</p><p><strong>See More: <a href=#>Ashleigh Murray on Her Shirtless Introduction to Co-Star Luke Perry</a></strong></p><p>But Cott's second choice is Veronica for a completely different reason.</p><p>“She just seems like she knows where to hang out.”</p><h2 class=h2>Betty and Jughead's Flaming Relationship</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e2/o/2017/03/10/e25165b5265b50ff97868aa6224493b6_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">The CW</span><p>Betty and Jughead's <a href=#>steamy kiss last week</a> was a big shocker to “Riverdale” fans because that awesome moment was not included in the original comic book series. Cott loves how the writers gave Jughead a romantic interest and really dove into developing his character alongside Betty.</p><p>“[Betty and Jughead] are so sweet and complicated in different ways and it's really cool when they come together. It's one of my favorite character developments.”</p><p>Cott even referred to the couple with a cute celebrity name – “Bughead.”</p><h2 class=h2>When He Heard Season 2 Renewal News</h2><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>There has been a lot of exciting buzz on “Riverdale” receiving an early renewal for a second season. <a href=#>Although KJ Apa told TooFab</a> that he expected the news, Cott said he was caught by surprise.</p><p>“I was walking to Chelsea, New York and I got a text saying, 'Congratulations!” And I was like, “What?” So I looked at Twitter and was so excited and texted our group chat.”</p><h2 class=h2>Will there be a burger-eating contest in the “Riverdale” future?</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/75/o/2017/03/10/7597c74302c45ec6a65b60f2b6dbffe5_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Well, if it were up to Cott, absolutely. The actor wants to set up a Pop's burger-eating contest against Jughead next season.</p><p>“Kevin will win!”</p><p>Cott ended with a plea to watch tonight's episode live and a promise that their writers are so incredible in developing each character that the way the story is about to unfold will “blow our minds.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnh7j2xmaXFfp7a3sdGdmKWdXajBor6MnJisnalisLDA02aYrpyZqbawusSdZJ%2BnomKus6%2FHopxmb12prqyxwLCYsqtdm7%2BwuYyhoKxllpawpq7OqKJmpJmrsm6vx5qraA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
