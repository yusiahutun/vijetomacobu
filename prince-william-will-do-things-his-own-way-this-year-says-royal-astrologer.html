There were also predictions about his relationship with his wife <a href=#>Kate Middleton.</a> The next 12 months are looking to be very positive for William indeed after a few turbulent years within The Firm such as difficulties with his brother, <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>. Harry and his wife, <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a>, left the royal family in January 2020. They did so, apparently, without warning and so it may have caused the Prince of Wales some stress and uncertainty, but now four years later, things seem to be looking up.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1235143883-741x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-william-s-astrology-reading-for-2024>Prince William’s astrology reading for 2024</h2><p>A <a href=#>royal</a> astrologer, Debbie Frank, told HELLO! Prince William would have a “game-changing” year ahead, according to the reading.</p><p>He will apparently start the first couple months of 2024 in “planning mode” as Saturn “schedules his responsibilities and commitments.” Then, from March 25 until April 25, there will be a full moon that will affect both him and Kate, 41. It will see the couple come together in a “team effort.”</p><p>In May, he will have a “feel-good factor” in both his personal life and public engagements.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Prince Harry’s plan to fight the press was feared to be a ‘recipe for disaster’</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-william-s-42nd-birthday-is-important>William’s 42nd birthday is important</h2><p>According to his 2024 astrology reading, Prince William’s birthday (June 21) is an important one as he will “break with tradition” and “create new initiatives.”</p><p>Frank <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained</a>: “The great mover and shaker planet Uranus encourages breaking with tradition and creating new initiatives. We can expect William will ‘make a difference’ and do things his way during this time.</p><p>She continued: “Autumn is another big pulse point for the Prince. The eclipsed New Moon on his Mars in statesman-like Libra expands his reach in the world. October is going to be a power month for the Prince and Princess of Wales. The autumn and winter ready William for 2025 which continues to raise his star.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-change-of-heart-for-william>A change of heart for William</h2><p>Despite <a href=#>the drama of Megxit</a>, Prince William may not mind standing out from the rest of his family and doing things differently if his 2024 astrology reading is to be correct. This is also a change in attitude from 20 years ago, when the future king apparently “worried” over public reaction to his university decision.</p><p>While studying at the University of St Andrews in Scotland – where he began in 2001 – he changed his major from Art History to Geography after things didn’t “click” for him, but <a href=#>it wasn’t without much thought</a>, royal authors Dylan Howard with Andy Tillett claim their book Royals At War.</p><p>“William had been immersing himself in the world of Old Masters and classical art—he hadn’t clicked with the subject, and worse, he was terrified of public failure,” they penned. “He was preyed upon by the prospect of getting a reputation for weak work or an uninspired degree at the end of years of hassle and fuss for everyone.”</p><p>They added: “Given William’s status and, yes, the huge amount of work that had gone into creating a safe space for him to work and live, Charles counseled caution.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle’s feud ‘affected Harry’s relationship’</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2V%2FcLzRoqWcnV2stq24yJqkZq%2BZoblusM5mq6GhnpzAbrTIrGSor55ixKLFjK2foqtdrrKivoysmLKrXae8uq3LZpisrKKkubCzxKtm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
