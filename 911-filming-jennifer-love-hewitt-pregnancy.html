In season five fans saw her struggle with post-partum depression, and Maddie decided to leave her baby with her partner Howard ‘Chimney’ Han and disappears.&nbsp;At the time, Jennifer explained: "I knew when we started the storyline&nbsp;where it was going to end up. And taking the break to go have a real baby and then come back to it was strange and a little daunting. <strong>It was really important to us to tell the real story. PPD, postpartum depression, has been done on other shows, it's something that's out there."</strong></p><p id=eIVPLQ6MloId data-wc=49>Leaving Chimney a message, she wrote: "I’m sure that you are confused, hurt, and probably really scared.
