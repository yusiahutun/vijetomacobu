Lily and Molly [her daughters with ex Brian McFadden] would come home from school and I'd say, 'just go upstairs'. I'll never forgive myself for that."</p><p>As she became emotional, Linda asked Kerry if she tried to 'shield the kids' from what was going on, to which she replied: "They never saw anything but they heard it a lot of it."</p><p>But who did Kerry Katona date before George Kay and why did they split up?</p><p>Here's everything you need to know.</p><h3>Brian McFadden</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27870536.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Brian-McFadden-and-Kerry-Katona-at-Westlifes-World-of-Our-Own-launch-party-in-London.jpg><p>Former Westlife star Brian McFadden first met Kerry when the boyband and Atomic Kitten toured together in 1999.</p><p>Three months after meeting, Brian proposed to the singer and they welcomed daughter Molly in August 2001.</p><p>They then had a huge celebrity wedding in 2002, surrounded by their nearest and dearest.</p><p>A year after the nuptials, their daughter Lily-Sue was born.</p><p>However, the once loved-up pair separated in 2004, shocking the world and their fans.</p><p>The pair had a messy divorce but the former Westlife star later confirmed that they had patched up their differences as they both moved on with new partners.</p><h3>Dave Cunningham</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article28227278.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_KERRY-KATONA-VISITING-A-COSMETIC-SURGERY-CLINIC-LIVERPOOL-BRITAIN-28-APR-2005.jpg><p>Following her bitter split from Brian, Kerry rekindled with her childhood sweetheart Dave Cunningham.</p><p>The pair then got engaged in 2005 but they split soon after a row while on holiday in Spain, when Kerry reportedly discovered decorator Dave had been seeing his ex-girlfriend behind her back.</p><p>A source told the People at the time: "Kerry is devastated. After everything she has gone through this year she truly believed Dave could be her saviour.</p><p>"Then the shocking revelations about his ex emerged. But because her private life has been made public before, she made a pact not to discuss the split."</p><h3>Mark Croft</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article20773825.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/161095_2.jpg><p>After her split from Dave, Kerry met taxi driver Mark Croft and the pair soon got engaged.</p><p>The couple tied the knot on Valentine's Day in 2007 and they share two children together, daughter Heidi and son Maxwell.</p><p>However, the marriage wasn't perfect as during their time together, Kerry, who was once worth an estimated Â£6.8million, was declared bankrupt.</p><p>During the relationship, the Atomic Kitten star made her infamous This Morning appearance during which her slurred speech and behaviour caused concern with host Phillip Schofield and with viewers.</p><p>Kerry admitted she was addicted to cocaine and that she'd go on 'three-day coke binges' with Mark.</p><p>She said: "I hated my life. I'd lie in bed for three days in a row doing cocaine with Mark. We did coke in our en suite and had a lock on the door. The kids knew if the bathroom door was locked they mustn't come in."</p><p>The couple then split in 2010, with Mark later admitting that he 'bled her dry'.</p><h3>George Kay</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28196110.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Celebrities-at-the-ITV-studios-London-Britain-26-Mar-2015.jpg><p>In 2012, Kerry met ex-rugby player George Kay when he worked as her driver.</p><p>A few months later, George proposed to Kerry at the top of the Blackpool Tower.</p><p>The singer then fell pregnant with daughter Dylan-Jorge in April 2014 and the couple got married later that year.</p><p>However, two months after they tied the knot, their relationship took a turn as George was hospitalised with 'signs of a stroke' in June 2014 and Kerry struggled to cope.</p><p>They briefly split after George's behaviour became too difficult for Kerry to deal with, but they got back together and renewed their wedding vows.</p><p>The pair's turbulent relationship continued and in June 2017, the couple split for the final time following a string of shocking claims of domestic violence and substance abuse in the marriage - which Kerry previously revealed made her feel 'worthless'.</p><p>Kerry then took out a restraining order against her ex-husband.</p><p>George died in July 2019, aged 39, from a drug overdose which shocked his ex-wife.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>ate a ball of cocaine in front of horrified hotel staff</a> and suffered a fatal seizure.</p><p>During an appearance on Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins, filmed in 2020, Kerry broke down in tears while discussing her time with George.</p><p>When asked by Ant Middleton about her emotional reaction to one of the challenges, Kerry said: "My mister died last year of a drug overdose. He was really abusive, and it just took me back to feeling really worthless."</p><p>In her new memoir, Kerry recalls an incident where her ex-husband attempted to strangle her during a car journey.</p><p>She wrote: "I could barely breathe and honestly thought I was done for, when he released his grip, pulled over, opened the passenger side door and dragged me out of the car by my hair.</p><p>"I fell, hitting my head on the door. He spat on me, got back in the car and drove off."</p><h3>James English</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article15377017.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Kerry-Katona-and-James-English-1116065><p>Following her split from George, Kerry met Scottish comedian James English and the pair soon hit it off.</p><p>The songstress soon plastered her new man over social media but after a few months of dating, the couple called it quits with Kerry announcing the split on Instagram as she spoke about her new single life.</p><h3>Ryan Mahoney</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article23907714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_Kerry-Katona.jpg><p>Kerry then met personal trainer Ryan Mahoney in 2018 and she soon shared a loved-up snap of the pair on social media, claiming that she was 'officially spoken for'.</p><p>The couple met on dating app Bumble and seemed very happy together until they split following a make-or-break trip to Thailand a few months after they made their relationship official.</p><p>After taking some time away from one another, the pair reignited their flame the following year.</p><p>In fact, Kerry announced their reunion in her New! column in 2019, when she confessed that Ryan was a "godsend" to her, after the death of ex-husband George.</p><p>Before lockdown was put in place in March 2020, Kerry and Ryan made the big step of moving in together with her children.</p><p>And after spending months of lockdown together, Ryan decided to pop the question to Kerry in August 2021.</p><p>The couple are still going strong today and are now considering surrogacy after trying to conceive for four years.</p><p><b>Read more:</b></p><ul><li><p><b><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>Kerry Katona 'mortified' as famous footballer said he masturbated over her OnlyFans</a></b></p></li><li><p><a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>Kerry Katona says ex Brian McFadden âis a better dad to new baby than he was to my kidsâ</b></a></p></li><li><p><a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>Kerry Katona says abusive ex George 'threatened to inject baby DJ with heroin'</b></a></p></li><li><p><a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>Kerry Katona's secret bust-up with Katie Price after she snubbed wedding role over dress</b></a></p></li><li><p><a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>OnlyFans millionaire Kerry Katona thinks of ways to save cash in cost of living crisis</b></a></p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKuYpMSjtdloop6qoq56rK3TqKWaq12nvKS32GapnqSRqbawutKhoKllmJ7AtbvRsmRrcGJnf3ODkA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
