She let everyone know her younger daughter is in a relationship. Here's what the Food Network host posted on Instagram and the hilarious way fans responded.</p><p>Published on March 15, 2022</p><span></span><span>3 min read</span><p id=par-1_37><a href=#>The Pioneer Woman</a> announced two new happenings in her younger daughter’s life. One of the new events is that Paige Drummond has what her mother describes as a “new friend.” Here’s what <a href=#>Ree Drummond</a> had to say.</p><h2 id=h-ree-drummond-doesn-t-like-using-the-title-boyfriend>Ree Drummond doesn’t like using the title “boyfriend”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Paige-Drummond-The-Pioneer-Woman.jpg><p id=par-2_65>Drummond prefers not to refer to her daughter’s significant others as “boyfriends.” When her eldest child, Alex, started dating her husband, Mauricio, Drummond called him Alex’s “friend.” She continued to do this until Alex and Mauricio were engaged. <a href=#>The couple got married last year</a> during a breathtaking wedding ceremony on the Drummond ranch. Drummond took to Instagram to explain why she doesn’t like saying “boyfriend.”</p><p id=par-3_48>“I can’t say the word “boyfriend” as it relates to my girls,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">says</a> Drummond. “It just won’t come out of my mouth. It isn’t so much that I’m in denial or afraid to face the fact that my girls are growing up—it’s more of an Elaine Benes thing”</p><p id=par-4_28>Drummond goes on to talk about a Seinfeld episode where a character keeps referring to her significant other as her fiancé. She also introduces Alex’s then-husband, <a href=#>Mauricio Scott</a>.</p><p id=par-5_74>“Did you see the episode of <a href=#>Seinfeld</a> when the girl at the party kept mentioning her ‘fiancé’ constantly? (“My fiancé said this” and “My fiancé said that” and “Have you seen my fiancé???”),” asks Drummond. “That’s how I feel about the word ‘boyfriend.’ (“My daughter’s boyfriend said this” and “My daughter’s boyfriend said that” and “Have you seen my daughter’s boyfriend???”) Anyway, please enjoy this photo of my daughter Alex and her FRIEND, Mauricio!”</p><h2>Ree Drummond introduced Paige Drummond’s ‘friend’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_67>Drummond recently announced two things on Instagram. First, she let her fans know that Paige got a brand-new haircut. Second, Drummond announced Paige has a “new friend.” Judging from how Drummond usually refers to her children’s love interests, we can safely assume she really means this is Paige’s boyfriend. “Paige has a new haircut and a new friend. OK, bye,” says Drummond on her social media page.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_86>Although Drummond describes Paige’s boyfriend as “new,” he began appearing on her Instagram page in September 2021. Many fans commented on how much Paige’s “friend” looks like Mauricio. In the picture, he can even be seen wearing a polo shirt and jeans, which is an outfit Mauricio typically wears. One fan said they thought the young man in the picture was Mauricio. Another fan said, “He looks like your son-in-law.” Someone else joked that Drummond used to call Alex’s husband a “friend” before they were engaged.</p><h2>Paige Drummond once shared her thoughts on applying for ‘The Bachelor’</h2><p id=par-8_50>Last year, Alex held a question-and-answer session on Instagram called Ask Alex. During the session, someone suggested that Paige should try out for The Bachelor since she wasn’t in a relationship at the time. Paige didn’t agree. “I just truly don’t think that’s in the cards for me,” she replied.</p><p id=par-9_62>Some of the fans watching the video voted ‘no’ to Paige being on The Bachelor, but Alex says she feels like she wants to nominate her sister to be on the show. However, Paige agrees with the people who don’t think she should be on the reality series. “I agree with them!” she exclaims. She later adds, “I’m literally 22 and single.”</p><p id=par-10_25>Well, it doesn’t look like Paige is single anymore. Could there be another <a href=#>Drummond wedding</a> in the future? We’ll just have to wait and see.</p><p id=par-11_17><strong>RELATED</strong>: <a href=#>‘The Pioneer Woman’ Ree Drummond Joked Her Children’s First Boyfriends or Girlfriends ‘Don’t Stand a Chance’</a></p><p id=par-12_5>Follow Sheiresa Ngo on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMqaCoppWav27DzqaYp2WimrJusNGupKannpl6qrrTq6adrZOawG68wKKenmWemsRustGinKecXZuur7%2BMnJinrF2csrV5zq%2Bcq2WimsCmucGlmKeblWK6osHRopqip16dwa64jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
