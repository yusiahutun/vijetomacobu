Also, growing up, she was an insecure girl and seemingly slow, which led her mother to call her 'lamebrain'.</p><p class=align-left>When she was a teenager, Griffith got into a bit of trouble, leading to a run-in with the law. The encounter led her to believe that she was a sinner and Godless. This, combined with her strict Christian upbringing, led her down the path of religious extremism.</p><h2>Activism career</h2><p class=align-left>There is not much information about Griffith before the death of her son Bobby Griffith, but she is rumoured to have been a teacher. However, all that changed when Bobby died in 1983. The 20-year-old had realized that he was in<a href=#> high school </a>and was afraid to tell his friends, especially his family, who had extreme anti-gay views.</p><p class=align-left>When Bobby told his family that he was gay, he received a little support from his father and siblings. However, Griffith, on her part, was vehemently against him and took him for counselling at a local <a href=#>evangelical church</a>. She also left Bible verses on his dressing mirror in an attempt to help him change.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/829de05e282f6c74.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Dave Matthews' wife?

After some time, he left home for Portland, where he lived with his boyfriend. A few months later, he visited his family, where Griffith again continued to pressure him to repent, telling him that “he could change if he wanted to”. Ultimately, Bobby gave up and committed suic*ide by jumping off a freeway overpass.</p><p class=align-left>After Bobby’s death, Griffith changed her stance on homosexuality. The suic*ide forced her and the rest of the family to realize that acceptance was more vital, despite religious and personal beliefs. Her change of heart led her to PFLAG (Parents, Families, and Friends of Les*bians and Gays), one of the largest American organizations that campaigns for LBGTQ rights and equality.</p><p class=align-left>Over time, Griffith became an outspoken gay rights activist and would share her story with other parents and families. By doing this, she hoped they would not go through similar tragic experiences.
