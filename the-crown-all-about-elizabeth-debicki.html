I can't really explain it. It's pretty incredible that a dress would represent a moment in history, or that this human's life would represent so much and become so iconic. So that was a big day on set for me!"</strong></p><h2>Why is Elizabeth Debicki taking over from Emma Corrin?</h2><p id=e42sNySQh72u data-wc=36>Emma Corrin, who is six years younger than her successor, was only intended to <a class=hm-link href=#>play the late Princess</a> during her youth.
