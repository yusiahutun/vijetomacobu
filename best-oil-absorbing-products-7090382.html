Nothing short of mattifying miracle workers, these products — which come in the form of papers, powders, sponges, and rollers —&nbsp;soak up excess oil to prevent a shiny complexion from stealing the show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, like most beauty products, there are many, many oil-absorbing products on the market — and they’re not all worth the hype. To find out which are the best, we put the most popular oil-absorbing products to the test. We recruited a dozen testers to try over 20 products in our lab, keeping in mind ease of use, absorbancy, and overall appearance. After looking at ratings and insights we were able to narrow the list down to the top 10 that sop up oil like magic. At the helm of that list is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Shiseido Oil Control Blotting Paper</a>, which is beloved for its ease of use, featherlight feel, absorbing power, and ability to not disrupt makeup in the process.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-shiseido-oil-control-blotting-paper></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Shiseido Oil-Control Blotting Paper</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=shiseido-oil-control-blotting-paper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/72sLIEKYro71A6GjxvYcaKWwjpI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shiseido-oil-control-blotting-paper-ca08903110f0426a81be4f04ef384ae5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Macy's</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorbency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During our test we tried an array of papers, rollers, sponges, and jellies, but none performed nearly as exceptionally as&nbsp;Shiseido Oil Control Blotting Paper. Our tester loved everything about this product — from the paper’s ultra-lightweight feel to the mattifying powder-coated finish, and especially how well it soaks up excess oil. “The sheet is the perfect size to touch up an oily T-zone,” she says, noting that the papers are soft and smooth to the touch. “There was a lot of oil visible on the paper after blotting and I was happy to see it didn't smudge or remove any of my makeup.” In fact, after using these our tester was amazed to find that her makeup looked “flawless and airbrushed."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Logistically, these blotting papers have a powder-coated finish that’s formulated with oil-absorbing kaolin clay, as well as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>zinc oxide, which is often found in SPF.</a> Together, these ingredients absorb excess oil and soothe the skin.

From the soft, lightweight feel of the papers to just how well they soak up excess oil to reveal a natural-looking matte finish, there’s so much to love about the popular papers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I have oily skin and I felt fresh and not overly matte [after using these],” says one tester. “There was a significant difference —&nbsp;my skin normally is oily, but the blotting paper helped keep it matte without stripping my face of too much makeup.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike some of the other products on this list that are infused with a long list of ingredients, these are made simply with just two: ​Natural abaca leaf and gold flakes to soak up excess oil and reduce inflammation (a common benefit of gold on the skin).<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredient: </strong>Abaca Leaf and Gold |<strong> Format: </strong>Papers<strong> </strong>| <strong>Sheets: </strong>40</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-nyx-professional-makeup-matte-blotting-paper></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NYX Professional Makeup Matte Blotting Paper</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=nyx-matte-blotting-paper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2HsSmltNlpNanunfEoGVI34UPdc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nyx-matte-blotting-paper-ba1d1ae5c0e14993b467d27a03dfa95a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorbency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">NYX Matte Blotting Paper has amassed over 1,600 five-star ratings on Amazon — and for good reason: The thin, smooth, lightweight papers are easy to pull out of the packaging (without risking extras coming out in the process) and seamlessly make shine disappear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“The texture of the paper felt very soft and light on my skin,” our tester marvels. “I hardly felt the paper on my skin at all, but it absorbed all of the excess oil right away.” While it removed all traces of grease, the papers didn’t remove any makeup, which made them stand out even further, especially as a budget pick.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like the Tatcha Blotting Papers, these sheets are made simply, with 100 percent pure pulpate paper.

Where some powders leave a garish white cast, this does not. “It didn’t leave any trace on my skin,” says our tester. Dabbing this powder over your face completely eliminates the look of shine. “It will not smudge makeup as long as it's pressed, but if the sponge slides on the skin, it will smudge your makeup,” she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If our tester could change one thing about this popular product, it’d be the sponge that with comes it. The thin, flat sponge doesn’t have a loop to grip, so it can be tricky to remove from the compact. It’s also worth noting that, since it comes with a sponge, you’ll be reusing the same tool to absorb oil over and over again, which isn’t the most hygienic. Still, you can wash the sponge with your other makeup brushes to keep it clean, and the overall performance is simply unbeatable.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredient: </strong>Talc and silica |<strong> Format: </strong>Powder</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-charcoal-infused-boscia-black-charcoal-blotting-linens></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Charcoal-Infused</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Boscia Blotting Linens</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=boscia-black-charcoal-blotting-linens style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/CtJt87_o2LXN81DJiNMqjNlVUnE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/boscia-black-charcoal-blotting-linens-3f4f3859d10945d8aa7d1e1778287534.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorbency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>The papers are thin, soft, and smooth, allowing them to easily cater to the contours of the face.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Where many blotting papers are white or light pink, Boscia Black Charcoal Blotting Linens are black. Infused with oil-absorbing black charcoal, these sheets work to instantly soak up excess oil, leaving skin looking beautifully mattified — and you can see that they work! “I noticed the excess oil on the blotting paper,” says our tester. “The papers do a good job absorbing my face oil and they’re great for freshening up during the day.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beyond how well they work, these papers are stowed in a slim cardboard package that fits easily in the palm of a hand, as well as in a zippered pouch in a bag. We especially recommend the latter, as simply tossing the cardboard package in a full bag could lead to crumpled corners, which wouldn't affect how well the papers work, but still — we like our beauty products to look the part.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredient: </strong>Charcoal |<strong> Format: </strong>Papers<strong> </strong>| <strong>Sheets: </strong>100</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-14 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=4349 data-sizes=750px alt="Woman tests Boscia Black Charcoal Blotting Linens" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0KGxKNlkvq7Uo9E_H_Z4akMa-lc=/fit-in/1500x4349/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-oil-absorbing-products-test-boscia-black-charcoal-blotting-linens-tstaples-466-4d07e4a113104d0d8ff3927e8cae1fcd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Tamara Staples</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4365 data-sizes=750px alt="After photo of woman who tested Boscia Black Charcoal Blotting Linens" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/e7ZfhPz5iZpQIioyjREGwc6o3Mw=/fit-in/1500x4365/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-oil-absorbing-products-test-boscia-black-charcoal-blotting-linens-tstaples-528-b6c46ced56064a2ca53f77495edc8112.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Tamara Staples</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-natural-pleasingcare-natural-bamboo-charcoal-oil-absorbing-tissues></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Natural</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>PleasingCare Oil Absorbing Tissues</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=pleasingcare-natural-bamboo-charcoal-oil-absorbing-tissues style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/cn2CWDyz4FpyeXAEiSNUaSaLTSw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pleasingcare-natural-bamboo-charcoal-oil-absorbing-tissues-024a9fe6a3d2485789907d1f18f42bc4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorbency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Over 11,000 Amazon shoppers have awarded PleasingCare Natural Bamboo Charcoal Oil Absorbing Tissues five-star reviews&nbsp;— for more than one reason.
