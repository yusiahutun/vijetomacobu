in her becoming hooked on Class A drugs.</p><p>A few years after Michael's death, in 2000, Paula also passed away, due to what would seem to be an accidental heroin overdose.</p><p>After her death, Bob's three children went into his care - along with Michael and Paula's daughter Tiger, who he brought up as his own.</p><p>On what would have been Peaches' birthday (March 13), Daily Star has looked into the lives of Bob and Paula's children, including Peaches, Fifi, Pixie and Tiger.</p><h3>Peaches</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32338919.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_ben1.jpg><p>Peaches started out her career aged 15 when she began writing a column for Elle magazine.</p><p>Shortly after this, she left home and went on to write for the Telegraph and the Guardian, as well as presenting TV shows including ITV2's OMG! with Peaches Geldof.</p><p>The sassy and quick-witted British columnist was a bold TV personality in the showbiz world and also knew how to work a pose in the modelling industry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>On 7 April 2014, Peaches was found dead by her husband Thomas Cohen at their family home in Wrotham, Kent, leaving behind two sons.</p><p>The coroner found that the cause of her death was "opioid intoxication", and recorded a verdict of drug-related death, with stark contrasts to her mother's passing.</p><p>Pathologist Peter Jerreat said during the inquest that there was evidence of codeine, methadone and morphine found in her blood stream, alongside a "fatal range" of heroin.</p><h3>Fifi</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article21610967.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Peaches-Geldof-death.jpg><p>Fifi is the oldest of Bob's children and is 39-years old.</p><p>The eldest Geldof sibling has previously revealed that she suffered from clinical depression since she was 11.</p><p>She was just 17 when her mother Paula died and as a result, became fiercely protective of half-sister Tiger Lily Hutchence, who was 13 years younger.</p><p>Fifi declares herself as the “unknown Geldof”, as she has done her best to stay composed and stay out of the tabloids since growing up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19896414.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Peaches-Geldof-Thomas-Cohen-and-sons-601721><p>She went on to have a successful career at a London PR company for more than 12 years and also dabbles in makeup artistry.</p><p>Fifi married sand sculptor Andrew Robertson in Kent in 2016, which was actually at the same church where her mum and younger sister Peaches are buried.</p><p>In 2021, she was the spitting image of Paula with a new short bleached blonde hairstyle which appeared to be an ode to her mum, as it was around the time it passed 20 years since Paula died.</p><p>At her wedding, she chose not to have Pixie and Tiger Lily as bridesmaids, as she said it wouldn't have "felt right" to have them by her side without the late Peaches there too.</p><p>Fifi still decides to keep a low-key social media presence and has a private Instagram page, where she labels herself as a "makeup artist and enthusiast of dogs".</p><h3>Pixie</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25133168.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Live-Aid-Screening-Arrivals.jpg><p>Pixie, the third child, has gone on to have a successful modelling career.</p><p>Her first magazine cover appearance was for Tatler in 2008 and has since been the face of advertising campaigns for brands such as Levi's, Diesel, Henry Holland, Razzle, Agent Provocateur, Loewe and Pringle of Scotland.</p><p>She also modelled for top designers Vivienne Westwood, Luella and Jeremy Scott, along with Debenhams in 2010.</p><p>Pixie has also dabbled in music and is the lead singer of the band Violet, who released their first single in May 2012.</p><p>The star was also scheduled to DJ at the 2014 Coachella in April but had to cancel her performance due to the death of her sister.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24362734.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Fifi-Robertson-Geldof.jpg><p>Pixie is passionate about marine wildlife, and has done work as an advocate for marine conservation and against animal testing in the cosmetic industry.</p><p>The beauty married George Barnett, drummer of These New Puritans, in June 2017.</p><p>They had a star-studded wedding in Majorca with friends such as Daisy Lowe, Alexa Chung and Harry Styles in attendance.</p><p>The model has plenty of friends in high places, including royalty, and has been pals with Princess Eugenie who also attended her nuptials.</p><p>The couple share one child who was born in 2021, after she announced her pregnancy with a silhouette shadow of her bump on Instagram.</p><h3>Tiger</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25133600.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_UK-Premiere-Of-Pirates-Of-The-Caribbean-Dead-Mans-Chest-Arrivals.jpg><p>Following her mother's passing, Bob became Tiger Lily Hutchence's legal guardian and now, aged 26, she is said to be living a quiet life out of the public glare in Australia.</p><p>Alongside Tiger, who graduated from Goldsmiths University of London in July 2019, her other remaining siblings still go on each day feeling the heartache of their great loss.</p><p>Fifi and Pixie have reportedly become a super tight unit with Tiger since the passing of their sister Peaches, who tragically died in a similar way to her late mother.</p><p>Big sister Fifi even insisted that she shared a room with Tiger for years in order to help instil an aversion for fame in her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article23828297.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1279187633jpeg.jpg><p>Tiger was just 16 months old when her father, INXS frontman Michael, passed away in November 1997 and just four when her mother died.</p><p>One of Paula's pals, Jo Fairely, called to check on Paula at the time but Little Tiger was the one to pick up the phone, saying her mum was still asleep.</p><p>When Jo arrived, Tiger had to stand on a chair to let Jo in — but as soon as she looked into Paula’s bedroom, she knew her friend was gone.</p><p>In 2018, it was reported that Tiger Lily was dating the frontman of the Australian psychedelic rock band Pond, Nicholas Allbrook.</p><p>It is now rumoured that Lily is engaged to the 33-year-old, but nothing has been confirmed by the couple.</p><p>A source reportedly told Now To Love: "When they got together, people found it interesting that she dated a muso like her dad, but that's where the similarities between Nick and Michael end.</p><p>"He is a very low-key sort of bloke and they live a normal life in Fremantle. It's all about their music, the ocean and each other."</p><p><b>For more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>here.</a></b></p><p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p><ul><li><p><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Bob Geldof drops F-bomb in front of Harry and Meghan during One Young World speech</a></b></p></li><li><p><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>David Dickinson, 81, 'not quitting' Dickinson's Real Deal as new series in the works</a></b></p></li><li><p><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Corrie's Elle Mulvaney begs co-star Jack James Ryan to make soap return months after exit</a></b></p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKuYpMSjtdlomaiaXZyyrbDOn6pmnpGivLa%2FjJyfoqSUp7Kvec2ormZqZWaAdHyXbw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
