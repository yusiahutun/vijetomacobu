During their chat, she invited him to the Keeping It Real 24/7 food bank and he accepted.</p><p>It seems that others had doubts that the 41-year-old would ever turn up, but Wendy kept on hoping. She <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> Manchester Evening News: “Everybody loved it. Is he going to come to Moss Side, that’s the question people want to know. I said ‘of course he is’. I know he is going to come to Moss Side.”</p><p>When the <a href=#>royal</a> arrived, he told her: “It’s been a while Wendy, I told you I’d come and see you.” He didn’t arrive empty-handed, either. The Prince of Wales came with a basket full of Jamaican food that can sometimes be hard to come by in the UK, including okra, yams, and dragon fruit.</p><p>Their organization also runs other facilities to help those in their community, like The Hideaway Youth Project, which provides activities and clubs to help young people lead healthy and fulfilling lives.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Princess Kate Middleton was asked to ‘change her name’ when she joined royals</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-helping-out-in-the-kitchen>Helping out in the kitchen</h2><p>William decided to get involved in the action, rolling up his sleeves to help make some food to be served.

I’m from Jamaica and I never thought I’d ever live to see any member of the royal family this close,” said Mr Moss.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-william-has-been-crowned-the-hottest-bald-man>Prince William has been crowned the hottest bald man</h2><p>William was found to be the <a href=#>world’s hottest bald man</a> recently after a survey found that 88% of women found bald men attractive. The Prince beat some of the biggest <a href=#>celebrities</a> around. It comes after he was dethroned in last year’s poll by <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star Vin Disel, who stars in the blockbuster Fast and Furious series.</p><p>To determine the number one spot, Reboot, an SEO Data agency, looked at golden ratio facial proximity, voice attractiveness, global search interest and cranial shine factor.
