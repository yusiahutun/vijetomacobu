Trouble is, sometimes reheating prime rib turns the meat dry and gray. To the rescue: We talked to a top chef for the best ways to heat up leftovers so they retain all the flavors of this rich and hearty beef roast. Here’s how to reheat prime rib so it’s tender and delicious a second time around!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What cut is a prime rib?</h2><p>Prime rib is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cut from the rib primal section</a> of the cow. It’s popular for roasting because it contains lots of marbling (fat streaks) that keep the meat succulent as it cooks. Whether you opt for a bone-in or boneless variety, a 8- to 10-pound prime rib can feed several people and leave you with yummy leftovers that last for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">up to 4 days</a> in the fridge. When you’re ready to enjoy those leftovers, reheating them on the stove or in the oven yields buttery results every time!</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Chef’s #1 secret for moist reheated prime rib</h2><p>You’ve already done the hard work of roasting your prime rib to perfection the day of. Now, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Courtney Rada</a>, chef and TV host, suggests gently reheating it to avoid tough and dry meat. “The trick is to cook it at a low temperature with some extra moisture to ensure it doesn’t dry out or lose that pink, tender center,” she says. A mild temperature and any leftover au jus (meat juices) will go a long way to creating succulent reheated prime rib.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>For 1 or 2 slices: reheating prime rib in a steamer</h2><p>If you’re only reheating a slice or two of prime rib, try this stovetop steamer method as it’s a quick and hassle-free option. All you need is a steamer insert that fits nicely over your pot and foil to hold in the meat’s juices. Then, you can follow Rada’s five steps for steaming success:</p><li>In a pot, bring in 1 to 2 inches of water to a simmer over medium heat before placing the steamer insert on top.</li><li>Tightly wrap each leftover slice with some of the meat juices in a piece of foil.</li><li>Place the meat pouches side by side in the steamer and cover the pot.</li><li>Allow meat to warm for about 4 minutes, or until prime rib is heated&nbsp;thoroughly and reaches an internal temperature of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">165°F</a>.</li><li>Remove the pouches from the steamer and allow the meat to rest for 5 minutes before serving.<br><strong>Note:</strong> If your steamer basket is too small, do this process one slice at a time.</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>For a whole roast: reheating prime rib in the oven</h2><p>A prime rib that’s still left whole yields more slices and is best warmed up in the oven for evenly heated meat. Here, Rada shares her six steps for reheating a whole prime rib roast in the oven:</p><li>Take the prime rib out of the fridge and allow it to sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes.</li><li>Preheat your oven to 300°F.</li><li>Once your prime rib reaches just about room temperature, place it in a roasting pan.</li><li>Pour your leftover au jus over the meat. (<strong>Note:</strong> You can also pour ¼ cup of beef stock over the meat.)</li><li>Cover the meat in foil and place in the oven until it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F. Cooking times vary depending on your oven, so check the internal temperature about every 10 minutes to ensure it doesn’t dry out or overcook.</li><li>Remove the prime rib from the oven and rest for 10 minutes prior to slicing and enjoying.</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A delicious prime rib recipe worth reheating</h2><p>Our test kitchen’s Rosemary-Kissed Prime Rib recipe is mouthwatering the day of and even more delicious once reheated.
