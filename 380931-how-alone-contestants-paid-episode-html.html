That and more happens in the Alone series, which airs on the History channel. Being "Alone" in the wilderness is no easy feat. So, how much do Alone contestants get paid per episode?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d1835a095975b535.jpg><p class=align-left><i>Alone </i>is the most intense survival series and the boldest and longest survival experiment on television. In the show, ten contestants are dropped at different places in a remote landscape to see who would last the longest. The series premiered on June 18, 2015, and has received positive reviews since its first season. The seventh season is currently airing on the History channel.</p><h2>About Alone survival series</h2><p class=align-left><i>Alone </i>is an American reality series that's currently set in Argentina. Just as the title of the series suggests, the series involves <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">participants being left alone </a>in the wilderness, and there are no camera crews following the participants.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/544bad48a42792ec.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Will Willis from Forged in Fire? Everything you should know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The participants cannot mingle with each other as everyone is sent on a mission to preserve his/her life alone. They must struggle to survive as much as they can as there are no luxuries and the weather conditions are highly unpredictable in the wilderness.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/544bad48a42792ec.jpeg><p class=align-left>The participants do not even have basic needs, such as toilet paper. They get to choose ten items to bring into the wilderness that will help them build their shelter, kill game, keep warm, and survive. Some of the basic supplies that they are allowed to carry along include a water can, sleeping bags, a bow, and six arrows.</p><h3>How much do Alone contestants get paid per episode?</h3><p class=align-left>The contestants on the intense survival series are tasked with putting their survival skills to test. Being alone in the wilderness is not easy, and one would expect that they would pocket a significant sum of money at the end of the series.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c9db6393104e2752.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Will Bleach Anime return in 2022?

This season's participants faced the biggest twist in series historyâ€”a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">100-day challenge </a>for 1 million dollars.</p><p class=align-left>The rules were simple, survive 100 days and win 1 million dollars. Over six seasons, no one has ever lasted this long. Achieving this goal is a struggle, especially when the survivalists have to endure the intense conditions and aggressive predators of the Arctic.</p><h3>Does 2nd place win anything on Alone?</h3><p class=align-left>The last person on the challenge is the only one who wins the grand prize. Winning second place in the survival series does not make one earn a single coin. They only get out with more survival skills. The mission for the series has always been to stay alive, and so if you come out of the wilderness alive, you will have accomplished the mission you were sent on.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fa16ffdcc0ccfb74.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 best multiplayer horror games you should play in 2021</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2d8bc62ecc1709bf.jpg><p class=align-left>Although there has never been a contestant who died or suffered serious injuries, the survivalists have always strived to accomplish the mission they were sent on. One can only cling onto the hope of being the final winner, or else, they will not get any amount of money.</p><h3>Do Alone contestants get toilet paper?</h3><p class=align-left>The contestants are not provided with toilet paper. They have to improvise the locally available leaves when visiting the toilet. You will be surprised to know that there are no toilets for them to use.</p><p class=align-left>The contestants go to a designated area where they dig a hole and use it for a toilet in inland non-ocean seasons. During the ocean seasons, the participants swim out in the ocean and let go of their stuff there. It seems awkward, right? Well, that's where they leave it!</p><h3>How do Alone contestants charge cameras?</h3><p class=align-left>There are no camera crews to follow the contestants in the wilderness as they are legitimately alone. This means that they have to continue with their daily living activities and keep their cameras charged and safe.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/44a0451294b26681.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How much money do Ink Master contestants get paid?

The participants get a weekly visit from a crew who come in to swap their battery cameras for them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c9db6393104e2752.jpeg><p class=align-left>Sam Larson, a participant of the fifth season, narrated how he once got a 12-day delay from the crew that was supposed to swap his batteries. Later, he found out that they had been stranded in a mudslide that had occurred in the backcountry.</p><h3>Who lasted the longest on Alone?</h3><p class=align-left>Zachary Fowler of season three is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">longest survivor </a>of the series. The 36-year-old man stayed for 87 days, alone, fending for himself on the shoreline of a lake in the badlands of Patagonia, South America.</p><p class=align-left>He grew up in Vermont, where he enjoyed outdoor activities with his parents, which might have sharpened him for this course. The slingshot enthusiast is a renowned boat builder and an off-grid homesteader.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c2eb6c508441b798.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The Voice contestants salary: How much does the winner make?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He started his own YouTube channel, where he teaches outdoor activities. With such skills at his disposal, Zachary simply applied his outdoor knowledge in the wilderness, which helped him become the longest survivor in the wilderness, all alone.</p><p class=align-left>Asked how it felt to be alone, Zachary said that he missed his family so much, but they were his drive and reason for being there.</p><h3>Do Alone contestants get paid if they don't win?</h3><p class=align-left>Tough as it looks, the contestants have to struggle and improvise most things, but only the last one on the challenge gets to go away with the grand prize. The price is appealing, right? Well, getting to be the last participant in the challenge is not as easy as it seems. Sometimes the weather conditions are unpredictable, and there are limited basic supplies.</p><p class=align-left>Now you how much do Alone contestants get paid per episode. You now know that it is only the final survivor of the challenge who gets paid. If you have never watched the show, you can tune in to the History Channel to see how the survivors struggle to accomplish the mission they've been sent to accomplish, which is to stay alive.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/41c47dc32c3574ce.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Survivor pay per episode: How much do the contestants get paid?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke gave a comprehensive list of <a href=#>North Woods Law cast and characters 2020</a>.
