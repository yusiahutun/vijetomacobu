She was killed shortly after a prop gun loaded with a live round misfired during rehearsals for a film Alec was working on as the lead actor and producer. “During the initial investigation, it was determined that actor/producer <a href=# id=auto-tag_alec-baldwin data-tag=alec-baldwin>Alec Baldwin</a> was the person that fired the weapon,” Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said during a press conference.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hilaria-amy.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/alec-baldwin.jpg><p>Attorney Brian Panish, who represents the Hutchins family, told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a>, “We want to thank the Santa Fe Sheriff and the District Attorney for concluding their thorough investigation and determining that charges for involuntary manslaughter are warranted for the killing of Halyna Hutchins with conscious disregard for human life.” Panish continued, “Our independent investigation also <a href=# rel=noopener>supports charges</a> are warranted. It is [a] comfort to the family that, in New Mexico, no one is above the law. We support the charges.” Here’s how Hilaria is showing support for her husband.</p><h2>How did Hilaria Baldwin react to Alec’s involuntary manslaughter charges?</h2><p>How did <a href=# id=auto-tag_hilaria-baldwin data-tag=hilaria-baldwin>Hilaria Baldwin</a> react to Alec’s involuntary manslaughter charges? His wife and the mother of seven children hasn’t made an official statement yet but she’s made it pretty clear how she feels about the constant <a href=# rel=noopener>press surveillance</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1233604139.jpg><p>On January 20, 2023, the day after news broke her husband would be charged for the accidental killing of Hutchins, Hilaria wore a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">green sweatshirt</a> emblazoned with the word “Empathy”. Later that day, she confronted a mob of reporters who had swarmed her while she clutched the couple’s <a href=# rel=noopener>infant child</a>. “I want you guys to realize we have seven kids and you being here to escort them to school and to be there when they come home is not good,” she said in a video published by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">AP</a> to TikTok.</p><p>She continued: “So on a human level, you guys know I’m not going to say anything to you. You know that. So please, leave my family in peace and let this all play out, OK? Let me kids come home and stay away from them. Because they ask me, ‘Mommy, what are all these people doing?’ and that’s a very hard thing as a mom to try to explain. So please, go home because I’m not going to say anything.”</p><p>An anonymous source was quoted in <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">US Weekly</a> saying that the Baldwins are trying to stay positive but are disturbed by the very real possibility Alec could serve time behind bars, as one charge of involuntary manslaughter includes the use of a firearm, which carries a mandatory five-year prison sentence. “Alec is stunned and absolutely devastated,” the insider said. “He’s trying to stay strong, but it’s a real challenge for him as the scale of this decision sinks in.” The source continued:&nbsp;“The very thought of serving time in prison makes him and Hilaria sick to their stomachs. They can’t even imagine that scenario and are telling each other there’s no way on earth this can ultimately happen.”</p><p>While speaking on her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Witches Anonymous</a> podcast, Hilaria said it had been an “emotional” time for her and her family. “I do so want to express to you how grateful I am for your support and your kindness and your reason,” she said, addressing her fans. “Quite honestly, without it, we would crumble. So thank you so much for being our rock right now because I don’t feel so strong.”</p><p>She added: “Kids are sponges and certain conversations are not always age-appropriate; we cannot deny that they don’t feel the energy and pick up on certain things in the family,” the fitness enthusiast said, adding that she wants “everything to be sunshine and rainbows all the time” for her little ones but also hopes “to teach them to be resilient.”</p><p>Baldwin’s attorney Luke Nikas of Quinn Emanuel told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People&nbsp;</a>on Thursday, “This decision distorts Halyna Hutchins’ tragic death and represents a terrible miscarriage of justice. Mr. Baldwin had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun — or anywhere on the movie set. He relied on the professionals with whom he worked—, who assured him the gun did not have live rounds.” He added, “We will fight these charges, and we will win.”</p><p>DA Carmack-Altwies appointed special prosecutor Andrea Reeb to oversee the case. “If any one of these three people—Alec Baldwin, Hannah Gutierrez Reed or David Halls—had done their job, Halyna Hutchins would be alive today. It’s that simple,” Reeb said in a statement. “The evidence clearly shows a pattern of criminal disregard for safety on the&nbsp;Rust&nbsp;film set. In New Mexico, there is no room for film sets that don’t take our state’s commitment to gun safety and public safety seriously.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Hilaria-Baldwin.jpg><p>Hilaria Balwin wears <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Celine sunglasses</a> in tortoiseshell ($460 at Bloomingdale’s)</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Mayfair Group EMPATHY crewneck</a> ($108 at Revolve)</p><p>According to District Attorney Carmack-Atwiles’ statement,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>New Mexico law</a>&nbsp;will be applied to the two charges against Baldwin, Gutierrez Reed and Halls. “The first charge can be referred to simply as involuntary manslaughter. For this charge to be proved there must be underlying negligence. Under New Mexico law, involuntary manslaughter is a fourth-degree felony and is punishable by up to 18 months in jail and a $5,000 fine. This charge also includes the misdemeanor charge of negligent use of a firearm, which would likely merge as a matter of law.”</p><p class=paywall>The statement continued, “The other charge is involuntary manslaughter in the commission of a lawful act. This charge requires proof that there was more than simple negligence involved in a death. This is also a fourth-degree felony punishable by up to 18 months in jail and up to a $5,000 fine. This charge includes a firearm enhancement or added mandatory penalty because a firearm was involved. The firearm enhancement makes the crime punishable by a mandatory five years in jail.”</p><p>Alec and Hilaria Baldwin became engaged in April 2012 and married on June 30, 2012, at St. Patrick’s Old Cathedral in New York City. Together, they have <a href=# rel=noopener>seven children</a>: Carmen, born August 2013, Rafael, born June 2015, Leonardo, born September 2016, Romeo, born May 2018, Eduardo, born September 2020, Lucia, born February 2021, and Ilaria, born September 2022. Alec also has one child, Ireland, 27, from his previous relationship with Kim Basinger.</p><p>After the birth of the latest Baldwinito in September 2022, Hilaria talked about whether or not she’s open to having more kids. “I would have said before [that I’m] definitely done,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> in October 2022. “Seven kids in, I feel like I am, but it’s Alec and me—so, time will tell!” She continued, “I have to say that once I passed three kids, I just embraced the chaos. We have a wild and super fun house. Always something going on.”</p><p>She also <a href=# rel=noopener>explained</a> how she feels about raising each one of them. “Being truly present for each one of them is hard, and I obviously don’t get it right all the time,” she said. “My two oldest have nightly homework that I do with them, and to balance play with the younger ones, breast-feeding the youngest—it can get to be quite a juggle.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ShoppingNewsletter_onsitegraphic.png alt="StyleCaster Shopping Newsletter Sign Up" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
