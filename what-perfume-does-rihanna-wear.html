So, when Hollywood bigwigs from Cardi B and Ryan Seacrest to Jennifer Lawrence gush over Rihanna’s scent, it must be that she smells unbelievably delicious.</p><p>Rihanna has her own signature scent line under the Fenty beauty brand. But, it may come as a surprise to her fans that RiRi doesn’t always wear her own perfumes. She mixes and matches her fragrance selection, making her a real pro at the art of smelling good.</p><p>So, what perfume does Rihanna wear? Why is everyone raving about the Diamonds singer’s scent? Read on for all the deets on the fragrance that’s got everyone talking about how good RiRi smells.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Is the Name of Rihanna’s Perfume?</h2><p>Rihanna has at least 11 best-selling perfumes under her Fenty Beauty line. Fenty Eau de Parfum is undeniably <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://fentybeauty.com/products/fenty-eau-de-parfum rel="nofollow noopener">her most popular perfume</a>, and the fragrance’s limited supply keeps pushing the price tag up.</p><p>Fenty EDP has sweet blueberry, orange blossom, and citrus top notes, a middle rose fragrance with soft, musky base notes, supported by a hint of vanilla and almond milk. The magnolia and geranium complement the rose note, giving this perfume a warm and sweet scent.</p><p>While she loves her Fenty Eau de Parfum, the business mogul often wears Love by Kilian, Don’t Be Shy. In an interview, her friend @StylistGent spilled the beans on what the superstar was wearing. The queen of music did not look too pleased about the whole world finding out about her secret to smelling good all the time.</p><p><a data-amazonimages title="By Kilian Love, dont be shy Eau de Parfum Perfume 50 ml,1.69 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)" href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41KSgt-Y4qL._SL500_.jpg alt="By Kilian Love, dont be shy Eau de Parfum Perfume 50 ml,1.69 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)" title="By Kilian Love, dont be shy Eau de Parfum Perfume 50 ml,1.69 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Kilian Paris Love, Don’t Be Shy, released in 2017, features a delicious mixture of soft orange blossom, caramel, vanilla, and marshmallow with a dash of sweet gourmand.</p><p>The top and middle notes give out a burst of citrusy notes and clean floral smells, while the amber base is saturated with sweet candy notes. It is no wonder everyone says Rihanna smells like a piece of fine dessert!</p><p>Other fragrances Rihanna wears include:</p><h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-0cfe7bd7 gb-headline-text">Giorgio Armani Armani Si</h3><p><a data-amazonimages title="Giorgio Armani Si Eau de Parfum Spray for Women, 3.38 Ounce" href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31eK+4OBFPL._SL500_.jpg alt="Giorgio Armani Si Eau de Parfum Spray for Women, 3.38 Ounce" title="Giorgio Armani Si Eau de Parfum Spray for Women, 3.38 Ounce" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>RiRi is already beautiful and sensual in her own right. Still, the original scent of Giorgio Armani Armani’s fragrance takes her appeal to a whole other level. Elegant and sophisticated, the fragrance boasts notes of rose, sweet honey, notes of bergamot, and bubblegum mixed with a whiff of ambroxan, patchouli, and vanilla. Wear this for evening dates, and you sure are to make an impression.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Rihanna Reb’l Fleur</h3><p><a data-amazonimages title="Rihanna Reb'l Fleur Body Mist for Women, 8 Ounce" href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41l-WCrsq9L._SL500_.jpg alt="Rihanna Reb'l Fleur Body Mist for Women, 8 Ounce" title="Rihanna Reb'l Fleur Body Mist for Women, 8 Ounce" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>It was rumored that Rihanna doesn’t wear her own perfumes, but that could not be further from the truth. While she loves other brands’ fragrances, she regularly dons her own. The Reb’l Fleur is one of her top floral fragrances, and she loves its sweet, fruity notes, which include a whiff of peach and notes of honey, plum, and red berries. In this sweet fragrance, you will also catch undertones of hibiscus and coconut, representing her Caribean roots.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Rihanna Nude</strong></h3><p><a data-amazonimages title="Rihanna Nude Eau de Parfum Spray for Women, 3.4 Ounce" href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41fVARl96LL._SL500_.jpg alt="Rihanna Nude Eau de Parfum Spray for Women, 3.4 Ounce" title="Rihanna Nude Eau de Parfum Spray for Women, 3.4 Ounce" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Nude is one of Rihanna’s top choices in her Fenty line of fragrances. Nude is not as bold as many of the pop star’s other fragrances– it has subdued musky scents, woody undertones, and notes of neroli, while the top tones give off a subtle and airy floral vibe, making this a solid choice for a chill late-night rendezvous.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Rihanna Ri Ri</h3><p><a data-amazonimages title="Ri Ri Perfume 3.4 oz Eau De Parfum Spray By RIHANNA FOR WOMEN" href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41t5ur69-NS._SL500_.jpg alt="Ri Ri Perfume 3.4 oz Eau De Parfum Spray By RIHANNA FOR WOMEN" title="Ri Ri Perfume 3.4 oz Eau De Parfum Spray By RIHANNA FOR WOMEN" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>If the name of this sweet perfume gives you the feels, it’s probably because it is meant to be a flirtatious fragrance for sensual yet sophisticated girls. RiRi by Rihanna features musk and sandalwood base notes, while the top and middle notes are saturated with hints of mandarine, orange, passion fruit, and rum. A drop of sweet notes such as honeysuckle and jasmine round out one of Rihanna’s favorite fragrances.</p><h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-0411f738 gb-headline-text"><strong>Tom Ford</strong></h3><p><a data-amazonimages title="Tom Ford Lost Cherry Unisex EDP Spray 1.7 oz" href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41PEEcXtIpL._SL500_.jpg alt="Tom Ford Lost Cherry Unisex EDP Spray 1.7 oz" title="Tom Ford Lost Cherry Unisex EDP Spray 1.7 oz" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Lost Cherry by Tom Ford is one of Rihanna’s best perfumes for date nights and everyday use.

The top and middle notes feature cherry liqueur, black cherries, and grapes. The result is a moody, irresistibly juicY perfume fit for a lady who knows what she wants and goes after it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why is “Kilian Love Don’t Be Shy” So Expensive?</h2><p>As of 2022, Rihanna is worth $1.4 billion, making her the richest female musician. Clearly, RiRi’s taste in expensive perfumes aligns with her billionaire status.</p><p>While Rihanna can easily afford a bottle of Kilian Love, Don’t Be Shy, and her other favorite fragrances, these perfumes are out of reach for most people.</p><p>So, why are the fragrances, including Kilian Love, too expensive for the ordinary person? There are many explanations, but the main one is that this iconic fragrance is made from rare and expensive essential oils.</p><p>When you pay for Rihanna’s favorite perfume, you are definitely getting value for your money in return. But if you want to smell like Rihanna on a budget, you can buy the signature fragrance she wears in smaller, more affordable bottles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmsKCRqXqxsdGfrKadXZm8pr%2BMq6ChmZ6jrm7DxJqpaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
