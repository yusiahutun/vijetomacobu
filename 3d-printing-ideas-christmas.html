Or did you buy a friend a generic-themed Christmas cup because you were running out of time?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Instead of running through the stores or endlessly scrolling for a unique gift or decoration, you can 3D print it and save the hassle.</p><p>If you haven't experienced the joys of 3D printing, you're missing out. The fact that you can turn almost any reasonably sized 3D model into a real-life object is amazing and is perfect for the Christmas seasonâ€”both as decorations and as gifts.</p><h2 id=miniature-christmas-tree>1. <a href=#>Miniature Christmas Tree</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/thingiverse-christmas-tree.jpg><p>When you just don't have the time, money, energy, or space for an actual Christmas tree, this miniature Christmas tree is a great 3D printing idea. It blends in perfectly on an office desk, a dorm desk, an entryway side table, a coffee table, a nightstand, and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you decide to place it on your office desk next to a computer, you could <a href=#>set a Christmas theme in Windows</a> to add to the festive spirit. An excellent way to liven up your workspace, isn't it?</p><h2 id=spinning-christmas-star>2. <a href=#>Spinning Christmas Star</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/thingiverse-spinning-star.jpg><p>This spinning Christmas star decoration can be mounted on top of a Christmas tree or hung from its branches. Its three concentric stars each rotate independently of the others, making for an interesting sight and a great conversation starter if you host parties during the holiday season.</p><h2 id=santa-ornament>3. <a href=#>Santa Ornament</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/thingiverse-santa-ornament.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A Santa ornament may not be original, but sometimes traditional trumps original. This soft and welcoming ornament fits in on any Christmas tree and can be spruced up either by printing with colored filament or painting after the fact.</p><h2 id=rudolph-ornament>4. <a href=#>Rudolph Ornament</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/thingiverse-rudolph-ornament.jpg><p>This Rudolph ornament is almost identical to the Santa ornament above, except it showcases a reindeer instead of Santa. The two complement each other quite well, and you should definitely have both of them on your tree. Besides adding the Santa and Rudolph ornaments, you can make the Christmas tree stand out with <a href=#>DIY Christmas lights</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=holed-christmas-ornaments>5. <a href=#>Holed Christmas Ornaments</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/thingiverse-holed-ornament.jpg><p>If you're more into generic ornaments that can be printed en masse and thrown all over your Christmas tree, then consider these holed Christmas ornaments. They strike the perfect balance between traditional and non-traditional: a normal ball shape with an unusual pattern!</p><h2 id=snowflake-decoration>6. <a href=#>Snowflake Decoration</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/thingiverse-christmas-snowflake.jpg><p>The final 3D printing idea for a Christmas ornament on this list is the snowflake decoration, which is simple, traditional, and mass-producible. They're delightful enough that you don't have to constrain them to your Christmas tree. Hang a bunch of them around the house for an authentic winter feel!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sleigh-and-reindeer-decoration>7. <a href=#>Sleigh and Reindeer Decoration</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/thingiverse-sleigh-reindeer.jpg><p>For something subtle but atmospheric, put one of these sleigh and reindeer decorations in every room of your house. It's thin and light enough to sit on top of any wall hanging, or you can use double-sided tape, or just set them up on shelves, counters, desks, etc.</p><h2 id=reindeer-figurines>8. <a href=#>Reindeer Figurines</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/thingiverse-christmas-deer.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These reindeer figurines offer a bit more dazzle and pop than the silhouettes above. Plus, they are noticeably more three-dimensional, making them a better option for coffee tables, dining tables, side tables, and anywhere else that you want to liven up. To get that glittery look, spray paint it with glittery spray paint!</p><h2 id=jointed-christmas-figurines>9. <a href=#>Jointed Christmas Figurines</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/thingiverse-christmas-figurines.jpg><p>Want to tap into the cute side of the holiday season? These jointed Christmas figurines are a great 3D printing idea, either as decorations for the house or as playthings for younger children (but not too young because these can be choking hazards). After printing, have some fun painting them but don't forget to gift one of them to your close friends and family members.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christmas-cookie-cutters>10. <a href=#>Christmas Cookie Cutters</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/thingiverse-christmas-cookie-cutters.jpg><p>These Christmas cookie cutters have a nice aesthetic quality, making them fit as decorations.
