All was good until he started getting trolled for the dark chocolate brown color of the Batman suit which the Houston rapper even managed to match with the color of his hot wheels parked in his garage.</p><p>Looks like the 29-year-old ‘Astroworld’ hitmaker took the trolling to his heart as the rapper deleted his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a> account and currently his social media page is blank as a white sheet. Travis has not addressed the issue on Twitter as of now. After the news of the rapper deactivating his Instagram account went viral, some fans were sad while others still made fun of his actions over getting trolled.</p><p>One user tweeted, “Mf like me have been hyping up everything Travis Scott been doing for the past 4 yrs...should’ve known that boi couldn’t take a lil cyber bullying.” Another one also made fun of the same and said, “I'm really tripping off of the fact that Travis Scott deactivated his IG because of his costume slander.” One individual praised Travis’ Batman suit and stated, “@trvisXX Sorry to hear about the backlash from what I thought IMO was an AWESOME Batman fit!! Everybody just wants to troll behind a keyboard these days instead of lift up or support. Hope to see you back on the gram! #CactusJack.” One individual added, “I had a good laugh at them Travis Scott jokes but like... I've felt that feeling before of being hype for something and people shooting it down. It's really not cool.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Mf like me have been hyping up everything Travis Scott been doing for the past 4 yrs...should’ve known that boi couldn’t take a lil cyber bullying 😂😂</p>— sosa (@akaSosa13) <a href=#>November 2, 2020</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I'm really tripping off of the fact that Travis Scott deactivated his IG because of his costume slander. 😂🤣</p>— 2020 is a scam 🥴 (@STFUkj) <a href=#>November 2, 2020</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en><a href=#>@trvisXX</a> Sorry to hear about the backlash from what I thought IMO was an AWESOME Batman fit🔥!!

A-listers such as Demi Lovato, Camila Cabello, Justin Bieber, Tom Holland, Billie Eilish, Shawn Mendes and a few others have earlier taken a step away from their respective social media accounts only to come back later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRorKKWw6q%2FjKyaqKykYrWiuMuorp6dnmKvosDMmqVmm5%2Bowba5xGarq6ecobKlecOeo56slWK2r7%2FTmp6rmZ1irqSvzq6lrWWimq6kwMiopaw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
