The good news is that it only takes a few DIY tasks to stretch their imagination and help them gain handy skills. When it comes to such projects, you can always reuse, recycle, and upcycle available resources.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Below are 10 worthwhile engineering ideas kids can try out during their free time.</p><h2 id=pizza-box-solar-oven>1. Pizza Box Solar Oven</h2><p>Let the sun rays cook a tasty treat for your child&nbsp;with this exciting project. There are various concepts children can learn from this process, like energy, recycling, heat, and solar power. The materials required include some heavy-duty aluminum foil, one pizza box, a razor blade, wire cutters, tape, or fencing wire.</p><p>Kids can paint the outer part black to make the box absorb more heat and speed up the cooking process. Make sure you’re around to help them with the fencing wire and razor blade. The project is low-cost, simple to grasp, and ecologically friendly.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=diy-electric-helicopter>2. DIY Electric Helicopter</h2><p>Test your kid’s engineering skills this weekend using this project. You’ll need sterile sticks, two DC motors (5V), one plastic bottle, drill machine, glue, glue gun, four straws, four electric fire, scissors, one auto/off button, and a switched battery box.</p><p>Kids will understand how their toy helicopter works, and they’ll gain the confidence to try out more complex tasks. Children can add some LED lights to the tail rotor for a beautiful look.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>DIY Electronic Summer Projects</a></span></p><h2 id=diy-bubble-blower-machine>3. DIY Bubble Blower Machine</h2><p>Children of all ages love blowing bubbles, and this fun and easy project will keep them amused for hours. There are different methods kids can use to make a bubble blower machine, but the basic electronics needed include a motor and fan.</p><p>Kids can use distilled water to produce bigger bubbles. Creating the machine in the backyard sounds amazing, since kids can later run around and chase&nbsp;the bubbles.</p><h2 id=electric-propeller-car>4. Electric Propeller Car</h2><p>Making an electric propeller car is an exciting project to help your kids make good use of their free time. They’ll need materials like a 9V DC battery, on/switch, candy stick, hollow cylinder, high-speed mini DC motor, wheels, stiff cardboard paper, wires, and double-sided tape. Kids can work in a group and have different propeller cars race for a more exciting experience.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>This project makes afternoons entertaining and allows kids to learn why and how cars work the way they do.</p><p>Check out these other exciting <a href=#>electronics projects for engineering students</a>&nbsp;if you want a few more inspirational ideas.</p><h2 id=diy-paddle-boat>5. DIY Paddle Boat</h2><p>Any water science experiment is welcomed by most children. Apart from being an engaging summer activity, building this paddle boat is fun. Younger kids can make a smaller one and use it in a bathtub, while older ones can explore in the pool. The amount of water bottles required depends on the size of the boat.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>For the deck, you’ll get your kid solid but light plywood and duct tape to strap the plywood and water bottles. Building the paddle mechanism may be a bit complicated since there’s some welding involved. Adults can take this part entirely or supervise younger kids.</p><h2 id=homemade-wobblebot>6. Homemade Wobblebot</h2><p>The Homemade Wobblebot is a must-try since it helps kids develop mechanical skills. Although the wobblebot doesn’t have any decision-making capabilities, creating one is exciting for young robotic enthusiasts. All supplies cost less than $10, all of which are readily available. Tools like an X-Acto knife and hot glue gun may injure young kids, so let them work under your supervision.</p><p>You’ll need items like two googly eyes, two AAA batteries, two battery holders, one dome-shaped lid, a pencil with eraser, SPST (single pole single throw), one DC motor, and a short piece of wire. Allow kids to paint the outer part to give the wobblebot a lifelike design.</p><p>Here are some other <a href=#>robotic projects ideas for kids</a>&nbsp;if you found this one interesting and want to discover others.</p><h2 id=simple-pneumatic-machine>7. Simple Pneumatic Machine</h2><p>Kids can learn the versatility of air pressure with this simple pneumatic machine project. The pneumatic-powered movement is quite satisfying for both adults and children. You’ll require components like craft sticks, straw pieces, masking tape, syringes, and a pipe cleaner.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The build is simple and doesn’t require hot glue, meaning kids don’t require adult supervision. Kids are required to fill the syringe with air instead of water to lower and lift their loads. The machine arm shouldn’t be too long; if it is, it’ll make the machine fall over frequently.</p><h2 id=paper-rocket-launcher>8. Paper Rocket Launcher</h2><p>Do your kids love watching rockets launch into the sky? Well, make them feel like the next prominent rocket scientist with this project. It’s simple and requires a few materials. They’ll need a two-liter bottle, tape, paper, and a ½ inch PVC pipe.</p><p>Adults should cut the PVC pipe for younger kids and let them paint it. Ensure the end of the paper is taped tightly to make the rocket launch effectively. Watching the paper planes soar high brings a sense of accomplishment to the kids.</p><h2 id=diy-smart-phone-projector>9. DIY Smart Phone Projector</h2><p>Here’s an easy and fun physics project your kid can participate in without any challenges. You’ll get your kid a shoebox, PVA glue, foam board, smartphone, magnifying lens, and glue sticks. Tools to complete the task include a hacksaw, cutter knife, X-Acto knife, hot glue gun, and a ruler.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The project makes children feel like they are in a movie theater, and it’s fun if they watch with the lights off. Setting the phone with the highest brightness makes images appear brighter and colorful. Note the tools that may pose risks to your child and offer help.</p><h2 id=homemade-spectroscope>10. Homemade Spectroscope</h2><p>Kids can make a homemade spectroscope in a few simple steps and use it to enjoy a spectrum of different light sources. This physics project requires an old CD, pencil, empty paper towel roll, tape, scissors, paint (optional), and a small piece of cardboard. Light experiments are engaging, so there’s no doubt your kid will love tackling this project.</p><h2 id=challenge-your-kid-with-these-fun-engineering-projects>Challenge Your Kid With These Fun Engineering Projects</h2><p>Engineering can be complicated, but the above projects are easy, fun, and engaging for kids of all ages. Most of these DIY tasks inspire children try more complicated concepts.</p><p>Parents won’t have a hard time searching for the materials needed since are readily available, and kids can work either individually or as a group.
