Uses for dental floss: safely remove a tick from Fido</h2><p>If you notice a dreaded black dot on your pup, remove it fast and effectively with floss. Grab a 3″ length of dental floss, tie it in a loop, and place it over the tick, aiming to tighten it right where the head encounters your dog’s skin. Next, gently and steadily pull the floss straight back to remove the pest. Place the tick in a sealed baggie to take to the vet for inspection later (or flush it down the toilet). The floss allows you to remove the tick safely without having to touch it,</p><p>“Using floss provides continuous, steady traction. When you pull the floss, it moves in a straight line, meaning the tick is less likely to break apart during removal,” explains veterinarian&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sara Ochoa, DVM</a>,&nbsp;founder of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How To Pets</a>. “Remember, though, always approach tick removal calmly and never yank or twist the tick out. You’re aiming for a smooth, controlled removal.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>11.

To ensure it stays put when you sew it back in place, use a length of waxed floss instead of thread. Just thread the strand through the needle and sew as usual. The coated floss is more durable than thread and won’t break down, so you can be sure your button stays in place for good.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>13. Start a fire easily</h2><p>Nothing beats relaxing by a toasty fire on chilly evenings­ — if only it weren’t such a struggle to get the flames going!
