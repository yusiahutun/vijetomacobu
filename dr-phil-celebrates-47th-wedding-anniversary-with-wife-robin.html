The longtime couple rang in <a href=#>their marriage milestone</a> aboard a yacht on the coast of Italy on Monday, August 14.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0"><span class="x_x_ContentPasted1 x_ContentPasted0">“Love is in the air,”&nbsp;</span>Robin, 69, captioned a tribute to Phil, 72, on Instagram. “I love you, Phillip, always and forever.”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">Phil also shared a post dedicated to his wife, revealing that they have been together since Robin was 19. Their youngest son,<a href=#><strong> Jordan McGraw</strong></a>, and his wife, <strong>Morgan Stewart</strong>, tagged along for the trip.

The boat ride along the Mediterranean seemed like the perfect getaway for the lovebirds, who currently reside in <a href=#>a stunning home in Beverly Hills</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">Their love story first began in the ‘70s when Phil’s younger sister brought Robin over to their house.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">“He comes into the room, and he goes, ‘Well, who are you?’ I thought, ‘Well, that’s kind of rude,’ and I said, ‘Well, who are you?’ And he goes, ‘Well, I’m Phil,’” Robin recalled. “So, I told him who I was, and we sat down, and we visited there in the family room for a couple of hours. He asked me out for the next night, and we’ve been together ever since.”</span></p><p dir=ltr>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Dr.-Phil-Celebrates-47th-Wedding-Anniversary-With-Wife-Robin-in-Italy.jpg><p dir=ltr><span class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">Their 1976 wedding was a dream come true. After more than four decades of marriage, Phil and Robin have been able to keep the spark alive by performing romantic gestures regularly.</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">“He always does the one thing he knows I really love and that is getting my favorite dessert for every occasion&nbsp;<span class="x_x_ContentPasted2 x_ContentPasted0">—</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span>wedding cake,” Robin gushed over her hubby. “That is my go-to dessert, and he knows I love it and always makes sure it is here for me.”</span></p><p><span class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">Phil and Robin, who are grandparents to four grandchildren, truly are happier than ever.</span></p><p><span class=x_x_elementToProof><span class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">“He is so romantic, when we were still in school, we had a little apartment and we were just as happy then as we are now,” Robin reflected. “He went out to the park out near our little complex and took a knife to a tree trunk and carved a heart and wrote, ‘PM heart RM,’ and took a picture of it and had it developed and framed it. I thought it was so sweet. It was the most precious gift ever.”</span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46dqWaomJ65bq%2FEpZybqpGpsrR5k3CroWWnmrGltc2gZJqmnp7Dpr7SmqmyZaeewal51qKdnmWipK%2Bquo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
