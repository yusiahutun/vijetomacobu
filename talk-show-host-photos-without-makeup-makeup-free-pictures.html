The </span><i><span>Today</span></i><span> host once revealed one of her favorite skincare products to lather on her body during her self-care routine. She swears by using Bio-Oil after every shower.</span></p><p><span>“It smells great and I think right when you get out of the shower … it moisturizes, and I think oil is a little easier to put on than lotion,” she said during an August 2021 </span><i><span>Today</span></i><span> segment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Like Jenna, Savannah often opts for a makeup-free look when she is hanging out at home with her kids, Vale and Charles, and her husband, </span><a href=#><b>Mike Feldman</b></a><span>.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>The legal analyst revealed that one of her favorite skincare brands is La Roche-Posay, which helps her achieve her radiant look.</span></p><p><span>“I spend most of the weekend without any makeup. But I do enjoy it, and I have fun putting makeup on a Friday or a Saturday night,” she wrote in an April 2018 blog post. “I’ve been trying to perfect the smokey eye for about a decade now. There’s something about it being a Friday night, and you’re going out to dinner with your friends, and you put music on, and you get to play with some eye shadow and just have fun experimenting.”</span></p><p><a href=#><b>Kelly Ripa</b></a><span> is another morning talk show host who loves sharing her latest beauty tips and tricks with the</span><i><span> Live With Kelly and Ryan </span></i><span>audience. In October 2019, the </span><i><span>All My Children</span></i><span> alum posted a bare-faced selfie on Instagram as she was getting her hair done. It wasn’t the only time Kelly went makeup-free in a post shared with her millions of followers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Kelly and her husband, </span><a href=#><b>Mark Consuelos</b></a><span>, enjoyed taking walks through Central Park near their New York City home. She shared a stunning selfie wearing no makeup after reuniting with her beau who had been away filming </span><i><span>Riverdale</span></i><span> in Canada. In the December 2020 picture, Kelly’s piercing blue eyes were captivating. A few years later, the New Jersey native revealed her stance on Botox and beauty standards.</span></p><p><span>“For me, it was just more of my comfort level,” she told </span><i><span>People</span></i><span> in September 2022 about getting Botox. “If I worked off camera, I would not wash my hair with regularity or wear makeup but when I started to see things that I didn’t like, I thought, well, the next turtleneck is going to have two eye holes. I’m not saying you should let people bully you into cosmetic procedures. These are </span><i><span>my</span></i><span> choices for </span><i><span>me</span></i><span>.”</span></p><p><b>Scroll below to see photos of talk show hosts without makeup.&nbsp;</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46tmKWjXai1sMOMoaasrF2ltbDAzqxksKGknby2wIymmKSdpaV6rq3KnqypZZansqZ5z6Kara2imsBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
