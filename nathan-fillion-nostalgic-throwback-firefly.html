I love it!!! I’m not a science fiction person but I think I just became one! Thank you for being part of a great show. Good job!”&nbsp;</p><p id=ethRC6FCUkg data-wc=33>Another person added: “Firefly got me through cancer. It’s so much more than just a show.” A third person wrote: “Firefly will never die.

As yourself. And the music.”&nbsp;</p><p id=ekC_e5yN0hdq data-wc=84>Joss Whedon’s show, which took place on the spaceship Firefly, was canceled by Fox network back in 2002 after just 11 episodes out of the 14 had aired. It received a disappointing viewership at the time, with some blaming the fact that the network had placed the show in the ‘death slot’ time on a Friday evening as one of the reasons for its failure. Since then, the show has received a cult following, and the characters returned for the movie Serenity in 2005.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4963796df050-the-rookie-100-epoisode.jpg><p id=e10akQspWIQb data-wc=23>Joss opened up about the show’s cancelation in a Q&A at the Film Society of Lincoln Center, admitting that the failure was “unendurable”.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Meet Nathan Fillion's rarely-seen lookalike brother Jeff" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/0635a1c34860-nathan-fillion-and-jeff-fillion.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Meet Nathan Fillion's rarely-seen lookalike brother Jeff" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Meet Nathan Fillion's rarely-seen lookalike brother Jeff</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="The Rookie cast before they were famous: see epic throwback photos of Nathan Fillion, Eric Winter & more" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c3cb5728f9e2-eric-winter-melissa-oneil-and-nathan-fillion.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="The Rookie cast before they were famous: see epic throwback photos of Nathan Fillion, Eric Winter & more" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>The Rookie cast before they were famous: see epic throwback photos of Nathan Fillion, Eric Winter & more</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e2GjJdaBzKQz data-wc=77>He explained: “It was exactly the show I wanted it to be the moment I started. And so to have it ripped untimely from the womb was not acceptable to me. I felt not only this incredible loss, but that I had lied to the actors, that I had let them down, that I had told them, 'If it's good, and you're good, then everything will be fine.’" We’re glad it all worked out in the end!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/39b95453c1a4-nathan-fillion-the-rookie-season-6.jpg><p id=eVqBbosw7VpB data-wc=36>Nathan, who played the lead role, of course, went on to have a fantastic career, having starred in shows including Castle, A Series of Unfortunate Events and The Rookie, which was recently renewed for season 7.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHnhdKPtlk8y data-wc=63>Sharing the happy news, Nathan said: “It’s a good feeling to have work. It’s even better to be able to take pride in that work. If you are among those who are enjoying The Rookie, we owe you our thanks. Thank you, for having excellent taste in entertainment. Season 7, here we come. (And let’s not forget ABC! Thanks for being so supportive!).”&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
