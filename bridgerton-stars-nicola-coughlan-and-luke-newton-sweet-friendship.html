Ahead of <a class=hm-link href=#>Bridgerton's</a> third outing, Lady Penelope herself – aka <a class=hm-link href=#>Nicola Coughlan</a> – has teased the spiciest episodes yet, declaring that she and Luke Newton have officially "won the sauciness battle" on <a class=hm-link href=#>This Morning</a>. &nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>Bridgerton releases new Penelope and Colin scene from season 3</figure><p id=ePOFBa2p-0F data-wc=62>Abuzz with anticipation, our perennial wallflower is set to fan the flames of love with one Colin Bridgerton this time around, a storyline that has presented its challenges. Initially 'terrified' about filming the intimate scenes, Nicola and Luke – who have been close friends for four years – were able to lean on one another for support, sharing a laugh between takes.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/39de185a7d67-penelope-and-colin-bridgerton-season-three.jpg><p id=erJw-6m30Bq data-wc=50>And clearly their hard work paid off – these two exude chemistry in the teaser clips released so far! Ahead of grand return on May 16, we're taking a closer look at the duo's enduring friendship over the years. Here's what Nicola and Luke have said about each other…</p><p id=eAu8wxpCoay data-wc=41>Reflecting on their journey, in 2023, Nicola told : "Luke and I read the books at the beginning of season 1, and it was funny to us. We were like, 'Imagine if we have to kiss and do this.'</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f5c02298ae37-luke-newton-and-nicola-coughlan-bridgerton-set.jpg><p id=eNDSlyBkBrM data-wc=62>"And then season 3 came on and we were like, 'Oh god.' And then it's like, it's my friend. I have to kiss my friend," she continued. "You can't pretend to kiss someone, you have to really kiss them. It's a spicy one. It's a lot of the stuff from the books that the fans expect has made it into the show."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4dfe93cbd618-luke-newton-nicola-coughlan-bridgerton-set-in-costume.jpg><p id=eq-_IgWULEI data-wc=73>While Penelope and Colin's changing dynamic meant filming more risqué scenes than they're used to, Luke has credited Nicola with making him feel perfectly at ease. "I feel like there's always that question being asked of, is it easier to do the intimacy scenes or the more romantic scenes with someone who is your friend of four years or someone you just met for one day?" he explained to in February.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Bridgerton Season 3: fashion fans are all saying the same thing" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c531e1e7fef3-snapinstaapp4265701066921960097899068480001584172424840n1080.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Bridgerton Season 3: fashion fans are all saying the same thing" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Bridgerton Season 3: fashion fans are all saying the same thing</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Bridgerton reveals swoon-worthy new Anthony and Kate clip ahead of season three – watch" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/1578b0d7f8e3-bridgerton-season-three-kate-anthony.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Bridgerton reveals swoon-worthy new Anthony and Kate clip ahead of season three – watch" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Bridgerton reveals swoon-worthy new Anthony and Kate clip ahead of season three – watch</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="11 biggest things we learned at Bridgerton season 3 sneak peek event" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/43255ca5e2ac-bridgerton-s3-1.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="11 biggest things we learned at Bridgerton season 3 sneak peek event" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>11 biggest things we learned at Bridgerton season 3 sneak peek event</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Bridgerton's Simone Ashley stuns in white mini dress as she marks special occasion with surprising celebrity friend" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/bff975ce51c9-simone-ashley.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Bridgerton's Simone Ashley stuns in white mini dress as she marks special occasion with surprising celebrity friend" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Bridgerton's Simone Ashley stuns in white mini dress as she marks special occasion with surprising celebrity friend</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=ewtdOElsBa2 data-wc=53>"I can safely say it's easier with a friend.
