Some were filmed arriving in old cars, a contemporary fashion show’s display of pomp and circumstance. Dotting the walls were small landscapes and still lifes by the late American painter Albert York, depicting everyday scenes—flowers in a vase, a woman sitting in a chair.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The arresting humbleness of these works may seem incongruous with the outsize, provocative vision that Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson has dreamed up for the brand. But that simplicity is exactly what drew him to these one-dimensional pieces, and inspired a collection that is anything but. In his research, Anderson discovered York’s work and learned that Jackie Kennedy Onassis was a collector of the artist’s paintings. He started thinking about the provenance of a creation, and how the meaning of a craft can morph over time in the hands of new people and in a new context. After all, art lives on after it leaves the hands of its creator. That York was a bit of a recluse, whose paintings graced the home of an elite American icon, was top of mind for Anderson. It brought up notions of class and wealth and how what was once considered aristocratic or ceremonial is now almost “grotesque,” the designer explained backstage after the show.</p><img alt="loewe fall 2024" title="Loewe Fall 2024" width=2574 height=3861 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/loewe-po-f24-005-65e356232179a.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">launchmetrics</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For Anderson, a starting point in developing this collection was a traditional 1920s-era Etonian morning suit—like the one, he noted, Prince Harry was forced to wear as a young boy attending boarding school. (King Charles’s younger son always looked predictably uncomfortable in it, because it was a hand-me-down uniform and didn’t fit properly.) Notably, outside of the royal family, no one wears these suits anymore, and Anderson relished the opportunity to create his own luxury ready-to-wear version. His subverts occasionwear as we know and have known it, cut perfectly and worn with billowy, pleated balloon-hem pants printed with radishes and flowers. In Loewe’s universe, formality is upstaged by imagination.</p><img alt="loewe fall 2024" title="Loewe Fall 2024" width=2574 height=3861 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/loewe-po-f24-021-65e35631e2bb9.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">launchmetrics</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One model carried a bundle of asparagus—a nod to provincial French ceramics that have been notoriously knocked off throughout history, and specifically by the short-lived dupe factory Chelsea in Britain. The purple-tipped vegetable spears were actually made from intricate beadwork (meant to mimic the texture of caviar), which was also applied to an architectural A-line dress with a very adorable dog rendered on the front. The canine was a tribute to mosaic rings featuring beloved pets of the members of high society. On a few of the perfectly tailored overcoats were collars fashioned from real wood chips in the exact style of the legs of a Chippendale table or chair, the likes of which have also been reproduced countless times over the last century. The sweet but slightly tweaked florals recalled the chintzy interiors of the homes of Onassis and her peers, who filled their abodes with decorative art and objets.</p><img alt="loewe fall 2024" title="Loewe Fall 2024" width=2574 height=3861 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/loewe-po-f24-012-65e3562a61f4a.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">launchmetrics</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With these pieces, Anderson made us think not just about the past, but also about luxury today and the value of things. He alluded to the kinds of attachment we have to—or disassociation from—the things we buy and wear. “Why do we buy things, and why do those things have meaning?” he asked. “It’s the idea of a Chippendale chair, of a commission of those chairs, and the idea of an outsider looking into a world [of the original maker] that we don’t experience.” Our perceptions of clothing and objects can shift and change over time, and often, our eyes are tricked into seeing something else. Anderson took a simple pinstripe suit and beaded the entire thing, crystalizing his fascination with the idea that “craft can nearly become something else.” He added afterward: “I think it’s always in an exploration stage, and you go back to it, and how do you look at historical craft that has nothing to do with fashion and reapply it to clothing?”</p><img alt="loewe fall 2024" title="Loewe Fall 2024" width=2574 height=3861 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/loewe-po-f24-052-65e35648e1ca3.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">launchmetrics</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Under Anderson, Loewe has thrived on pushing craft forward, both from a commercial perspective and in the eyes of the hard-to-move fashion industry. This collection, in its intelligence and fluidity, was such a clear example of his ability to provoke thought through garment construction and design storytelling.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But as much as his collections challenge us to think more deeply about the context of fashion, Anderson ultimately just wants people to take his creations and make them their own. “It’s so nice to be able to do an exhibition of these paintings that has never been done before in Europe,” he said. “To be able to share that with people and then have people be able to experiment with clothing—it’s such a fun process.” He left with a smile and some wise words: “It’s about having fun and being lucky to do so. Yeah, something roundabout there—make up whatever you want!”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">All the Looks From Loewe Fall 2024</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="loewe fall 2024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/loewe-po-f24-001-65e356224f4be.jpg title="Loewe Fall 2024" width=2574 height=3861 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Brooke Bobb is the fashion news director at Harper’s Bazaar, working across print and digital platforms.
