His parents Victoria and David couldn't be prouder of their teenager, who everyone agrees is polite, grounded and friendly despite growing up in the limelight. In honour of the big day, we take a look back at cute snaps from previous years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7c692c886a8b-brooklyn-beckham-z.jpg><p id=e89pELviPx0r data-wc=79>With his perfectly coiffed hair and nonchalant grin, Brooklyn is very much his dad's mini-me. When he stepped out with his mother to an awards ceremony last year, Twitter went into overdriving with users hailing him a "teenage dream" and the "new Harry Styles". One asked: "Why aren't all boys my age as beautiful as Brooklyn Beckham?" They echoed the sentiments of his fashion designer mother Victoria, who was seen showering her eldest son with kisses at the gala.</p><p id=e4Ydv5_C4q_yJ data-wc=33>Like his father the young man is also quite handy with his football skills too. He has already had a try out for Manchester United, David's old team, and has trained with Fulham.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/71f0d4bb1585-brooklyn-beckham-16-z.jpg><p id=e6YJCYVSxaLh data-wc=199>The sports ace doesn't want to put any pressure on Brooklyn and his brothers Romeo and Cruz to emulate him. David said: &nbsp;"As long as they enjoy playing football, I don't care whether they play at professional level or Sunday league level. "There's another area, in which the father of four definitely has mixed feelings about his sons taking after him. He doesn't want them rushing to get tattoos. He laughed as he told Jonathan Ross: "(The boys have) already said they're having tattoos done. And I said, 'Well, be different, don't have any tattoos.' And they said, 'No, we're going to have one. We're going to have, 'Mum and Dad' So I can't really say no to that!".Despite the tensions over tattoos, the Beckham household is undoubtedly a very happy, lively one. The reported how the family temporarily moved into a West London neighbourhood last year, before finding a permanent residence in Kensington. Neighbours recalled David and the boys playing football with the rest of the children in the cul-de-sac. Meanwhile, Victoria would wave cheerily at local residents on the way to and from her design studio. When the family moved on they were sadly missed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQbWdsaGRmhHODl2iZq6efoLm6uoybnJyjmJa6bn2UrZ9mmpmnwamwwLJm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
