But did the love last this time?</p><h2>Is Dave Navarro Still With His Girlfriend?</h2><p>The gossip tabloid pages went crazy on the news of the unlikely pair, Dave and Andrea, back in 2015, when <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Us Weekly</a> broke the information on the newfound couple.</p><p>As the source reported, the two met each other through a mutual friend who introduced them&nbsp;few months before the news of their relationship surfaced. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While many were stunned by the togetherness of the unexpected pair, a source mentioned they shared much more similarities than expected,</p><p>Even though they seem like opposites, they have a lot in common. They both have a wicked sense of humor and share a love of politics and dark eyeliner.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>However, the similarities did not seem to have kept them together for long. After just a few months of romance, Dave and Andrea parted their ways and were soon seen with different partners. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Andrea was spotted with a British rugby player in Bermuda, while Dave was spotted with a mystery woman in the streets of New York displaying affection for each other.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>As seen in the series of pictures by Dailymail, the guitarist and his mysterious girlfriend seemed to have shared a flirtatious connection suggesting the two were nothing less than a couple in love.</p><p>Dave Navarro with his mysterious girlfriend back in 2015 (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dailymail</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, since the end of his attention-grabbing relationship with his former reporter girlfriend, no news of his serious relationship has ever surfaced, which might suggest he is not in a committed relationship currently.</p><h2>Married Three Times</h2><p>The former Red Hot Chilli Peppers guitarist might have been taking a halt from his long history of failed romances. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>His first failed relationship that caught public attention was with his former wife, Tania Goddar, a makeup artist. After the two-years-lived marriage came to an end in 1992, the tattoo lover got married for the second time with Rhian Gittins in 1994, and that too did not last any longer.</p><p>With two failed marriages under his name, the guitarist took his time to remarry and eventually exchanged vows with his spouse number three, Carmen Electra, in 2003.</p><p>Dave alongside his third wife Carmen Electra (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But unlike any of his previous marriages, Dave went full-on with his third one as his star-studded wedding with Baywatch star Carmen was premiered on television screens through the show Til Death Do Us Part.</p><h2>Til Death Do Us Part</h2><p>Circulating around the love life of Dave and Carmen, the MTV reality show Til Death Do Us Part aired in January 2004 and ran for seven episodes.</p><p>While the world watched the seemingly happy couple jump onto a new chapter in life, their divorce in 2007 came as a shock.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The pair, who reasoned their split as amicable separation, confirmed they were <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">still in love</a> with each other after the divorce. Taking about the divorce, Dave remarked,</p><p>Carmen and I love each other, we are and always will be best friends. In fact, we are supporting each other through this time. What better way to get through a tough spot than with your best friend?</p><p>Reciprocating the same emotions, Carmen also let the fans know that they continue to support each other in every way. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunC8jp2Yr51do663rdGrpmalkae%2FqrHDZq6inpVitKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXupwMyl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
