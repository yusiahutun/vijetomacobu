Overall, he is one of the best-selling artists in all of hip-hop and that is not going to change anytime soon. At this point, he has millions of adoring fans who will continue to listen to his music, no matter what. Having said that, <a href=# rel>Baby is also focused on plenty of other aspects of his life.</a> For instance, he is a father to an eight-year-old son named Jason, and a four-year-old son he had with Jayda Cheaves.</p><p>The mother of his first child is Ayesha Howard, <a href=# rel>who goes by the name Lil Ms. Golden on social media</a>. Overall, their relationship together did not end particularly well. Howard has been very adamant about this in the past. Moreover, she has claimed that her breakup with Lil Baby made it hard for her to open up emotionally with other people. Recently, however, she spoke about co-parenting with Baby while on the My <a href=# class=text-word rel>Future</a> Husband podcast with Belinda D. Sanders. During this episode, Howard made it abundantly clear that she has no plans of ever getting back with Lil Baby.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ayesha-howard-speaks-on-lil-baby>Ayesha Howard Speaks On Lil Baby</h2></span><p>“I never dream about going back there," Howard explained. "When I dream about my knight in shining armor, it’s not him. It’s not like ‘oh, he’s going to come and save the day.’ I think I’m beyond that. Which is probably a big reason why I’m able to be mature about certain situations. ‘Cause when you still have a certain attachment and certain feelings, [pettiness] comes with it. But to be honest, it’s hard to go from sleeping with someone and loving somebody a certain way and to one day you decide [to stop.] Especially when you cut it off cold turkey.”</p><p>At this point, it is clear that Lil Baby has also moved on. Sometimes, people are just better off as co-parents. While it may be unfortunate for both parties, as long as both can be adults about it, it typically goes over just fine.
