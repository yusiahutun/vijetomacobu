Blige, leading her to decry, "These must be the children of Helen Keller!"</h2><p>It was controversial when <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> first released their best singer list on New Year's Day, and it's become controversial again now that number 29 has discovered its existence -- and who ranked higher than her.</p><p><a href=#>Chaka Khan</a> was a guest on Los Angeles magazine's <a href=#>"The Originals"</a> podcast and had no idea the list even existed until it was brought up during the show, per <a href=#>The Daily Mail</a>. To say she was unimpressed would be a gross understatement.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:79a05374-85ee-49e5-93e4-967d4d796caa data-container-ref=toofab:article:ffed7c6a-e6a7-41a8-9c66-4c099a5796dc data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8a/5by4/2023/02/07/8a2c516d0a064e6eacb2994fafc97246_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">No, Adele Didn't Walk Out During Harry Styles' Acceptance Speech at the Grammys</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The legendary singer had a respectable ranking in the Top 30, but she was more bothered by some of the singers the magazine ranked higher than her. When told <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a> placed higher than her, in fifth place, Khan said, "That must be some payola or some s--- like that!"</p><p>In response to <a href=#>Adele</a> landing higher than her on the list (22nd), Khan simply said, "Okay, I quit." But she finally erupted when 25th place <a href=#>Mary J. Blige</a> was mentioned.</p><p>"These b------ are blind as a motherf------ bat! They need hearing aids. They don't have hearing aids? They have no eyes. They have no ears. They must have a -- these b------, you know what?

The two women have some history dating back to a 1992 cover of Khan's "Sweet Thing" by Blige. Khan was not impressed, calling it "the song Mary J. Blige f----- up" in her own concerts for years.</p><p>The two did reconcile, at least somewhat, in subsequent years -- at least enough to collaborate on a duet together, "Disrespectful."</p><p>Khan did not say anything negative about the list's eighth singer, <a href=#>Beyoncé</a>. "I'm not gonna comment on that," she said, before adding, "she's a great singer, okay? She really has opportunity to be a great singer. She has what it takes. She got the chops, she does, okay?"</p><p>Khan, who is famously candid with her thoughts about her fellow artists, denied years ago ever calling Beyoncé a b----, so her careful response might have come with a full awareness of that.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4cb16ab5-0e2e-4a40-adb8-6e3569aeca7a data-container-ref=toofab:article:ffed7c6a-e6a7-41a8-9c66-4c099a5796dc data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/48/5by4/2023/03/02/48470c26ed764146884f332a77f8262a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Fox</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">The Masked Singer Recap: Epic Unmasking Reveals Pioneering Hip Hop Legend</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Khan also took no issue at all with the top voice on the list. Rolling Stone put <a href=#>Aretha Franklin</a> at number one, "as she f------ should be," Khan agreed. She also thought it was "great" Whitney Houston scored number two.</p><p>Ultimately, though, Khan said she doesn't put too much weight on the list. "These people don’t quantify or validate me in any way," she told the podcast.</p><p>Other female vocalists ahead of Khan on the list include Billie Holiday (4), Patsy Cline (13), Celia Cruz (18), Nina Simone (21), <a href=#>Dolly Parton</a> (27), and Mahalia Jackson (29). The legendary Queen of Funk wasn't the only critic of the list, either.</p><p><a href=#>Celine Dion</a> fans, in particular, were horrified to find that their favorite didn't even make the magazine's Top 200. Other artists snubbed from the list entirely include <a href=#>Madonna</a>, <a href=#>Cher</a>, <a href=#>Janet Jackson</a>, and Nat King Cole.</p><p>All lists are controversial, but these snubs made this one particularly so, and definitely gave people something to argue about on the New Year's Day holiday.</p><a id=gallery-link-fc784634-2eef-4ef6-842e-87cd82b9d7e3 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:fc784634-2eef-4ef6-842e-87cd82b9d7e3 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:ffed7c6a-e6a7-41a8-9c66-4c099a5796dc data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/db/4by3/2023/02/27/db5e6cebe39f47fbb520eec49cfc0871_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xmaWpfmLWit8BmoqGZnmKxqr%2FSnqpmpZGntqK0jJyYq52pYq6lscueZKaZoq56q3nBpaCgnV2nvK24yKeeZqukpLumv4ybnKysXai2r7PEq6pmpJmowXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
