So that got us thinking, what mix of products would be suitable for someone looking to get started in sim racing at home? And, how much would you need to spend? As it turns out, it could be cheaper than you think.</p><p>To build your first racing setup, you'll need two products ideally, a racing seat, or rig, and a racing wheel with included pedals. We've taken a look and reviewed some of the best products that might help you get started on your sim racing journey, without breaking the bank.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/article22098326.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_playseat_-challenge-at-home-4.jpg><p><br><b><br>Racing Seat/Rig - Playseat Challenge</b></p><p>If you really want to go basic with your sim racing set up, then you can just get a racing wheel and secure it to a desk, using a normal chair as your racing seat. But, you're likely to get a lot of movement in the chair and the desk, so it's not the best solution particularly in competitive play.</p><p>Luckily, Playseat has a product called the Playseat Challenge, which is a foldable racing seat with a thick metal plate over your knees to secure your wheel, and a pedal base by your feet.</p><p>The Playseat Challenge is incredibly easy to fold and put away, so it doesn't take up much room at all when you're not sim racing, because not everyone has got their own dedicated racing sim room!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/article22098328.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_playseat_-challenge-at-home-1.jpg><p>It's also really easy to get in and out of, because the metal bar holding the metal plate can be unsecured using a lock system, allowing you to push the metal plate and the attached wheel to the side allowing you to climb out gracefully (kind of).</p><p>The racing seat is comfortable and gives good back support, also providing a low racing position, with the metal plate able to be tilted up and down for a more comfortable position too. As you'd expect from Playseat, as it's a very reputable brand within the sim racing world, the product is of high quality and will last you for a good while, even if used every day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/article22098327.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_playseat_-challenge-6.jpg><p>There is little to no movement in either the pedals or the wheel itself when attached using the tightening system on both wheels, which is a very welcome experience and encourages you to push hard when racing. I've used this product for hours on end for the last few weeks and been very impressed with it's comfort and ruggedness.</p><p>The Playseat Challenge isn't badly priced either, being available for £199, which is a bargain compared to the more advanced racing setups that Playseat offer, which include the Playseat® F1, the first ever official licensed Formula 1 racing simulator, which is priced at just over £1000.</p><p>The Playseat Challenge offers an affordable and high quality racing cockpit for sim racing beginners, giving you the perfect base for your first racing setup.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/article22098333.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Packshot_TmxPro_EMEA-1.jpg><p><b>Racing Wheel and Pedals - Thrustmaster TMX Pro vs Logitech G920/G29</b></p><p>When it comes to choosing a racing wheel and pedals to get started on your sim racing journey, there are two companies that you should look at very closely, Logitech and Thrustmaster. For more advanced sim racers, there is also Fanatec, who offer a variety of very advanced racing wheels, but they are a lot more pricey.</p><p>We've tested wheel and pedal sets from both Logitech and Thrustmaster, so let's take a look at the first contender, the Thrustmaster TMX Pro.</p><p>In the Thrustmaster TMX Force Feedback Pro bundle, you get the Thrustmaster TMX Force Feedback wheel plus the three-pedal Thrustmaster T3PA pedal set, with this racing bundle costing around £239.99.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/article22098366.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_picto900-tmx.png><p>The Thrustmaster TMX Force Feedback wheel is 11 inches in diameter, features optical reading with 12-bit resolution, and a mixed belt-pulley and gears system, to make the driving sensation as smooth and accurate as possible for the price. It also has a 270 degree to 900 degree adjustable rotation angle, which is what you should be looking for in a racing wheel, as that means the wheel can turn two-and-a-half times, the same as in a road car.</p><p>The version we tested was for Xbox One and PC, featuring the D-pad and all of the Xbox One buttons that you'd find on a normal Xbox One controller, so that you don't have to move from your seat to navigate the menus, which is very handy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/article22098334.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_High_Resolution_JPG-107803_G920_Pedal_BTY-2_nolo.jpg><p>To test the wheels I used them on F1 2019, with the wheels on full force feedback. The Thrustmaster TMX feels like a massive step up from a budget wheel, as it feels well made, stable and you get precise feedback through the wheel itself. The wheel design makes it comfortable to use and the buttons are well positioned on the steering wheel, so that you can make adjustments while driving. The shift pedals located behind the wheel are also incredibly satisfying to use, with a lovely click with every upshift and downshift.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/article22098336.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_High_Resolution_JPG-G920_FOB_White.jpg><p>The pedals are 100% metal and feel incredibly robust. Without the optional Conical Rubber Brake Mod, the sensation when braking wasn't great, so I would highly recommend you fit it on the pedal to get added resistance when braking for a more realistic feel. You can always edit the sensitivity settings in-game, and the pedals themselves are adjustable, so you can have them higher, lower and even adjust the tilt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/article22098329.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Screen-Shot-2020-05-28-at-030820JPG.jpg><p>Onto the Logitech G920/G29, the specific wheel we reviewed was the G920, which is the Xbox One and PC version of the wheel. At £329.99, the Logitech wheel is a bit more expensive than the Thrustmaster, but does have a few extra features.</p><p>For the extra price you get a high-quality racing wheel covered in hand-stitched leather, dual-motor force feedback and solid steel ball bearings in the wheel shaft. It also looks more like a steering wheel from a modern car, as opposed to the Thrustmaster TMX's more basic, racing steering wheel look. The Logitech G920 uses helical gears modelled after gears used in automotive transmissions, also featuring a hall-effect steering sensor that uses magnetic fields to sense the position of the wheel. Fancy stuff.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/article22098331.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_drivingforce-panel-1-feature-4jpeg.jpg><p>Also included with the G920 are the fully-adjustable pedals, featuring a nonlinear brake pedal that mimics the performance of a pressure-sensitive brake system, which feels really nice when braking in-game, giving you a lot more feel. You also get the same 270 degree to 900 degree adjustable rotation angle, easy to use buttons on the steering wheel and feels like a well-made quality product, slightly bulkier than the Thrustmaster overall, in a good way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/article22098332.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Screen-Shot-2020-05-28-at-030851JPG.jpg><p>When pushing really hard on the same track and in the same game, both wheels feel quite similar and there's not too much difference in the feedback you get from the wheel. But of the two, the Logitech G920 gives a slightly better driving feel and has stronger force feedback, but this is what you'd expect for the higher price. In terms of lap times, I found that I was also slightly quicker when using the Logitech. Not by much, but every tenth counts!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/article22098330.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_drivingforce-video3jpeg.jpg><p>Both the Thrustmaster TMX Pro and the Logitech G920/G29 are quality racing wheels and perfect for sim racing beginners, and far superior to budget options out there on the market. Either wheel would be an excellent purchase for your racing setup.</p><p>When combined with the Playseat Challenge, this set up makes for an awesome sim racing experience and it led to hours and hours of fun in the sim racing world.</p><p>So, what are you waiting for?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKyVmLVws8CmoKefX5eytMCMq5icoZ6ceri0xJ6jZquVlsFurtSio52hnpx6c36Pcm9rcGI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
