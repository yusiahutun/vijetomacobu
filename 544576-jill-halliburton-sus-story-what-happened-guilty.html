At the time, Justin, a student at Broward College, informed the authorities that his mother had taken her own life. He said to the Broward County's 911 dispatcher,</p>"She just stabbed herself and threw herself in the bathtub."<p class=align-left>But after looking closely at his mother and noticing her bound hands, he retracted his statement. He told the 911 dispatcher,</p>"She looks so cut up.

Additionally, another knife was discovered just outside the residence's front entrance. They also collected Justin's blood-stained clothes as potential evidence and drove him and his father to the station for interrogation.</p><p class=align-left>According to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">New York Post</a>, investigators uncovered that Justin Su had a penchant for collecting knives, which made him a key suspect in the <a href=#>murder case</a>.

Examination of Justin's phone records and surveillance footage from Broward College corroborated his alibi, confirming he was not present at home during the time of his mother's death.</p><h2 id=544576-who-killed-jill-halliburton class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Who killed Jill Halliburton?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dd720e31aca80bc8.png><p class=align-left>Days later, the forensic analysis linked genetic material collected at the crime scene to a black 20-year-old Dayonte Resiles, whose DNA was already catalogued due to prior burglaries.
