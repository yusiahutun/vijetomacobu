"I've never done anything with that big of a production. I don't know if I could have. I think at the time that's what I was thinking."</p><p>Now, she just might be changing her mind. A recent inductee into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Parton's got her very own rock album — called Rockstar&nbsp;— coming out later this month. Not only does that project feature an array of star guests, from Beatles bandmates to Elton John and Stevie Nicks, but it also gives her a chance to put out music that's a little bit flashier, and that might fit well with that level of onstage production.</p><p>"It would make more sense," Parton says, regarding the idea of taking the Super Bowl halftime stage with her Rockstar material. "That might change. I might be able to do a production show."</p><p>Grammy-winning R&B legend Usher has been confirmed as the headlining act for the 2024 Super Bowl halftime show, meaning that if Parton is going to star in the slot, she'll likely have to wait until at least 2025 to do it.</p><p>The 2024 Super Bowl will take place at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas on Feb. 11, 2024, and air on CBS.</p><p><strong>Country Singers Who Have Performed at the Super Bowl</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnaecocZuvMCrq6imXajCsbHRZpmor5xitaK4xa2gpp1dqLWww44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
