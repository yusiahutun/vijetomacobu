Could anything be so lovely? I imagined the strands of eggs tangling with the strands of noodles, punctuated with a sesame-seed flecked sauce and crispy raw vegetables and I needed it in my life.</p><p><a href=# title="whisky whisky"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1448/25534810490_1cfb8da659_z.jpg alt="whisky whisky" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a href=# title="rolled up cooked eggs"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1584/25204984824_1c93c6b1d4_z.jpg alt="rolled up cooked eggs" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a href=# title="ribboned omelet"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1711/25208907513_212d5dbcb5_z.jpg alt="ribboned omelet" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>And then, as these things happen, a few days later I was clicking aimlessly around the web while I should have been, I don’t know, writing a cookbook or responding to email and fell down a summer ramen rabbit hole. Sure, we’re all about the ramen everywhere these days, but as the weather warms up in Japan <a href=#>ramen shops add a chilled ramen [Hiyashi Chuka Soba] to their menu</a>, usually topped with, among other things, those ribboned eggs that charmed me. The dressing uses ground sesame seeds, sesame seed paste, vinegar and sesame oil, which you know means it will be amazing and the options for etceteras are as long as your imagination (or as deep as the odd-ends of your vegetable drawer go, though imitation crab, cucumbers and tomatoes are the most common). That said, dishes like this can get complicated quickly and we’re firing on fewer cylinders these days, so I attempted to hone in as much as possible on the eggs and the noodles. When it’s actually summer here, I’ll probably pile on more seasonal vegetables.</p><p><a href=# title=pre-assembled><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1544/25740396511_23f30006a7_z.jpg alt=pre-assembled data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a href=# title="sesame soba and ribboned omelet salad"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1666/25740395811_985e672c41_z.jpg alt="sesame soba and ribboned omelet salad" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href=#>Potatoes with Soft Eggs and Bacon Vinaigrette<br><b>Two years ago:</b> </a><a href=#>Double Chocolate Banana Bread</a><br><b>Three years ago:</b> <a href=#>Coconut Bread</a><br><b>Four years ago:</b> <a href=#>Potato Knish, Two Ways</a><br><b>Five years ago:</b> <a href=#>Sally Lunn Bread and Honeyed Brown Butter Spread</a><br><b>Six years ago:</b> <a href=#>Breakfast Pizza</a><br><b>Seven years ago:</b> <a href=#>Migas with Tomato Chipotle Coulis</a><br><b>Eight years ago:</b> <a href=#>Hazelnut Brown Butter Cake</a><br><b>Nine years ago:</b> <a href=#>Italian Bread</a></p><p><i>And for the other side of the world:</i><br><b>Six Months Ago:</b> <a href=#>Zucchini Rice and Cheese Gratin</a><br><b>1.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Cauliflower Slaw</a><br><b>2.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Fudgy Chocolate Sheet Cake</a><br><b>3.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Roasted Apple Spice Sheet Cake</a><br><b>4.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Red Wine Chocolate Cake</a></p><p><b>Sesame Soba and Ribboned Omelet Salad</b><br>Inspired by Heidi Swanson’s <a href=#>Near & Far</a> and No Recipes’ <a href=#>Goma Hiyashi Chuka [Sesame Ramen Salad]</a>, dressing from the latter</p><p>Notes:</p><ul><li>I know I sound like a broken record, but I would love to convince you to <a href=#>always toast your nuts and seeds before using them</a>. For sesame seeds, you can do these in a skillet over low heat but you must watch it like a hawk and stir often because once they start picking up color, they go from golden to brown very quickly. This time I did it in a 350 degree oven, stirring every 5 minutes (I also go ahead and do the whole jar, so I have them for the next time). It took longer but the flavor was off the charts. When I ground the seeds, the whole apartment smelled nutty and wonderful.</li><li>The water in the omelet ribbons may sound odd, but I found the final texture of the eggs a bit softer and more apt to ribbon without breaking with it. If you’d like, you can use mirin (sweet wine) instead of water, and skip the sugar.</li><li>I love using soba (buckwheat) noodles here but ramen noodles are more traditional, and most rice noodles or rice “sticks” are gluten-free. You can make this a vegan dish by omitting the egg ribbons.</li></ul><p>Serves 4 for dinner</p><p><u>Dressing</u><br>4 1/2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds, plus more for garnish<br>3 tablespoons water<br>3 tablespoons soy sauce (use low-sodium for a less salty sauce)<br>2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon tahini<br>2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon rice vinegar<br>1 1/2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil<br>3/4 teaspoon granulated sugar, or more to taste<br>Chili sesame oil to taste</p><p><u>Omelet Ribbons</u><br>Neutral cooking oil, to coat skillet<br>3 large eggs<br>3 teaspoons water<br>A few pinches sugar<br>A few pinches salt</p><p><u>Assembly</u><br>1 9.5-ounce package buckwheat soba noodles<br>Raw vegetables of choice (we used julienned carrots, cucumbers and radishes, plus some snipped chives on top, which have recently reappeared in my garden!)</p><p><u>Make the dressing:</u> Put the toasted sesame seeds into a blender or food processor and run the machine until the seeds look like wet sand — it will take a couple minutes. Add the water, soy sauce, tahini, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, salt and chili sesame oil and blend until combined. Taste and adjust ingredients to your preferences.</p><p><u>Make the omelet ribbons:</u> Whisk eggs with water, sugar and salt until well-blended and even in color. Heat a 10-inch skillet (I really like using a nonstick here and for other crepe-like things) over medium and coat very lightly with cooking oil. Pour in 1/3 of mixture, which will be enough to coat the pan very thinly. (If your pan is bigger or smaller, use less or more accordingly per batch, the goal is to keep the egg very thin.) Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until the egg has set and the edges look dry. Carefully flip* the omelet and cook for 20 to 30 seconds on second side. Flip egg out onto paper towel to blot oil and repeat 2 more times.</p><p>Stack the three omelets together and roll them into a log. Use a sharp knife to slice the roll into very thin ribbons, thinner even than you see in my photos.</p><p><u>Cook the noodles:</u> In well-salted water until tender but firm for the time recommended on your package of noodles, usually 4 to 5 minutes. Drain noodles and run cold water over them to cool. Drain again, shaking out excess water.</p><p><u>To serve:</u> My favorite way for a family meal is to put everything out in separate dishes and let each of us assemble to taste. (Or, if you’re <a href=#>this</a> one, grab the bowl of egg ribbons and help yourself.) Or, you can toss the noodles with about half the sauce, then arrange it in a bowl with the omelet ribbons on top, followed by your vegetables. Garnish with extra sesame seeds and serve with additional sauce on the side.</p><p>* One day, when I have video on this site, I will demonstrate my crepe-flipping “method” for you but hopefully this will help until then: I use two thin spatulas (such as offset icing spatulas or a flexible fish spatula). The first smaller one goes under the edge and lifts the omelet/crepe enough that I can hold the second larger spatula in my other hand and slide it under enough that it goes past the center of the omelet/crepe. From here, it’s easier to flip without tearing.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-25721 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-25721 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
