He was 44.</p><p>Herbert’s death was first announced by his bandmates via the band’s Facebook page.</p><p>“We were devastated to learn that Oli Herbert, our friend, guitar player, and founding member of All That Remains, has passed away,” the band wrote in the statement “Oli was an incredibly talented guitarist and songwriter who defined Rock and Metal from the Northeast. His impact on the genres and our lives will continue indefinitely.”</p><p>His wife later confirmed his passing in a post on Oli’s Facebook page, writing: “Hello everyone this is Beth, Oli’s widow. Thank you all for the kind thoughts and words. I don’t want to go into what happened until we have a complete picture, but as soon as we do there will be a statement from the family on this page. In the meantime, please respect our privacy as there are still relatives being informed of Oli’s passing. Thank you.”</p><p>While a cause of death has not been disclosed, a statement from a publicist for his family indicated that his death appears to have been accidental.</p><p>“On behalf of Oli’s wife and family I can confirm that Oli Herbert passed away yesterday unexpectedly as a result of an accident which occurred on the property of his home. He was 44 years old. No further details are being released at this time. Funeral arrangements are pending and will be announced once that information is available. The family requests for privacy during this time but does wish to express their appreciation to fans worldwide for the outpouring of condolences,” the statement said.</p><p>As well, TMZ reported that police located Herbert’s body “in a pond near his Connecticut home.” According to TMZ, police said they do not view the death as suspicious but are waiting for an autopsy to determine the cause of death.</p><p>Herbert and his bandmate vocalist Philip Labonte founded All That Remains in 1998, along with drummer Mike Bartlett, who left the band in 2006, and bassist Dan Egan, who departed ATR in late 2002.</p><p>Over the past two decades, All That Remain released eight studio albums, including last year’s Madness. Their next album “Victim of the New Disease” is slated for release next month and was to be accompanied by a brief tour of the UK, starting on Dec. 1st at the Engine Room in Southhampton.</p><br><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZoVwfY9oaHBnZWuDd4SO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
