The 55-year-old admitted that he had wanted to “impress” Sandra but said he “didn’t really have game.” Sandra teased the Fresh Prince star by saying she remembered “exactly what happened” during their time together.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-smith-went-on-a-date-with-one-half-of-salt-n-pepa>Will Smith went on a date with one-half of Salt-N-Pepa</h2><p>The <a href=#>TV</a> star explained just what he did to win over Sandra, as he thought she was “special” and wanted to “floss a little.”</p><p>“I always had a thing for Sandy, but she was always dating somebody else,” Will explained, “Now she was single. We was both going to be in L.A. at the same time, so Imma shoot my shot.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift may have to wait ‘months’ to get engaged to Travis Kelce</a></p><p>Will Smith continued by laying out what he had planned for himself and the pop star, including watching the sunset from the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> hills.</p><p>“This girl was special and I wanted to impress her,” the <a href=#>celebrity</a> said. “So I rented a white Mercedes convertible just because I needed to floss a little bit. My plan was then to take her around Hollywood Hills, drive up Mulholland and all that, watch the sunset.”</p><p>“My concern was that I was going to get killed. That was my concern when I was trying to spit my game, but I ain’t really have nothing. I was always faked like I had game. I didn’t really have game.</p><p>“I was always in this full-on, trying to give the wildest flavor of having game, but that might have been the most terrified I had ever been trying to shoot my shot with Pepa. And I didn’t believe I had a real shot.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sandra-remembers-the-date-fondly>Sandra remembers the date fondly</h2><p>Despite the <a href=#>movie</a> star’s claims that he “didn’t have game”, the date left a great impression on the Salt-N-Pepa rapper. She remembers it so well that she shared a memory of her time with Will.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17>“We were out and we saw a homeless person and you gave the homeless person $100. I was like OK and it was so nice. And then we went to the Hollywood sign.”</p><p>Although they went on their date “sometime in early ’88” it didn’t work out and was a “one and done” event, the pair remained friends. Will, his longtime collaborator Jazzy Jeff, and the <a href=#>music</a> group &nbsp;“always really got along.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-isn-t-the-only-one-with-famous-romances>Will isn’t the only one with famous romances</h2><p>Will’s revelation of his potential romance with the Salt-N-Pepa star follows a lot of admissions from his wife, who has never been shy when <a href=#>talking about their married life</a>. Earlier this year, Jada said she believed Will wasn’t her soulmate. Instead, she <a href=#>named late rapper Tupac</a> as her true love.</p><p>However, she was quick to explain that, to her, soulmates don’t necessarily have to be people you are romantically linked to. “Our children can be our soulmates. I think [there’s] this kind of romanticized idea of, like, a soulmate. You know, there’s all kinds of definitions of soulmate.”</p><p>“If there is such a thing as past lives, I definitely think ‘Pac and I have traveled a few together.”</p><p>She said their connection was strictly platonic and they were just very good friends, insisting there was no romantic chemistry between the two.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift wears adorable but tiny earrings in tribute to beau Travis Kelce</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2eGcMPIpaNmq52ewal5zqmcp6tdqr1urcGorK1lkpq2r7OMrZyrqpmbtqawjKCmoqaXYryvecOaq55lp57BqXnAZqSepZKav267xWaqmqSkYrtuvMSpmGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
