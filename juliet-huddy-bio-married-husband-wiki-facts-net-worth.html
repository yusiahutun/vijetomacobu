This was after it turned out that she had made sexual harassment allegations against two of the station’s key figures – O’Reilly and Fox News co-president Jack Abernethy.</p><p>In September 2016, Juliet left Fox News. It was later revealed that she had reached an agreement with the network on the sexual harassment allegations. In return for her silence, Fox agreed to pay a six-figure sum and waived its right to initiate proceedings against Fox News.</p><p>Juliet Huddy came into the spotlight after she was hired by the Fox News Channel. Initially, she worked as a correspondent. Later she was transferred to the headquarters of the media company in New York City. That was after the attacks of September 11th.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Juliet-Huddy-1.jpg><p>In New York, Juliet hosted Fox & Friends and DaySide, among others. But she received a lot of attention through her talk show – “The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet”. Thanks to the many celebrities and personalities that she was allowed to interview on the show, her fame rose to the sky.</p><p>Although it is believed that Juliet left Fox News because of the sexual harassment scandal, she would insist that she left the show because it is “time to shake things up” and return to her true passion, which has always been music journalism.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Munro Chambers Bio, Twin, Girlfriend, Networth, Height, Body Measurements</a></strong></p><p>Shortly after she left FOX, she founded BlondeAndCrossbones. Juliet hopes that the online platform would help her to combine her solid journalistic background with her love for music. To fulfill this hope, Juliet has involved some of the big names in the music industry in the affairs of BlondeAndCrossbones. She has confirmed that she will be working with Don Jamieson of “That Metal Show”, legendary publicist “Metal Maria” Ferrero, pop culture commentator, and former “<a href=#>Howard Stern</a> Show” gossip artist Chaunce Hayden.</p><p>Their plan is to “talk to the players and legends of the hard music world” in order to “reunite lovers of mainstream music, rock, and metal”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Juliet Huddy Bio/Wiki/Facts</strong></h2><p>Juliet Huddy will celebrate her 48th birthday on 27 September 2017. She was born on this day in 1969 as Juliet AnnMarie Huddy. Her birthplace is Miami Beach, Florida.</p><p>While Juliet’s father, John Huddy, is a television producer, her mother, Erica Huddy, was a professional singer. Juliet has a brother who is also a journalist. His name is also John.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Juliet-Huddy-Bio.jpg><p>For all we know, Juliet and the two Johns worked with Fox. While John, the father, who was a consultant, left Fox a few months before Juliet, John, the brother, is still working as a correspondent for Fox News in Jerusalem.</p><p>When asked what influenced Juliet’s career, she would refer to her parents and say that appearances were in her blood; that she knew as a child that she would be in front of the camera and that she knew exactly what she wanted to do when she reached her early teens.</p><p>After graduating from Langley High School in McLean, Virginia, Juliet went to the University of Missouri, where she earned a degree in political science with a minor in sociology.</p><p>Records show that her career in journalism began when she was 23 years old. She worked for KARO-FM, a local radio station, and reported on city council meetings while still at school.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Juliet Huddy Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Speculation about Juliet Huddy’s net worth escalated after it emerged that Fox News was compensating her with a six-figure sum for her sexual harassment claims. Everyone wanted to know how much she was worth after Fox paid her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Juliet-Huddy1.jpg><p>Figures between $2 and $5 million were quoted as her net worth. Although the figures are given as her “estimated net worth”, this cannot be confirmed. It is, therefore, safe to say that she earned a decent living with the path she chose for her career.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Riveting Facts About Cameron Monaghan’s Career, Sexuality, and Relationship</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Married/Husband</strong></h2><p>By all accounts, Juliet Huddy has been married three times, and all this failed for reasons best known to her and her partners.&nbsp;In 2009, it was rumored that things fell apart between Huddy and her husband Doug Barrett.
