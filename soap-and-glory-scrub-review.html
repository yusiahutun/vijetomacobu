I tried multiple $40+ shower scrubs for exfoliation, but the $15 <a href=# rel=nofollow>Soap & Glory Flake Away Body Polish</a> bested them all. The consistency, the effects and the smell come together to turn any shower into a spa.</p><p>Although I’ve got my 7-step <a href=#>face skincare routine</a> down, I’ve never paid much attention to my body (save your lectures, I know it’s bad). I know that I’m supposed <a href=#>to moisturize daily</a>, but I really only remembered to do so when my skin felt noticeably dry. In the past year, I, like many other women—68 percent, in fact, according to Soap & Glory— are trying to spend more time on self-care. Exfoliating in the shower is an easy way to do that. You’re already in the shower, so you might as well take a few extra minutes.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p>The <a href=#>more expensive scrubs</a> I’ve used in the past had grainy consistencies. As I rubbed them into my skin, I couldn’t tell if they were actually working. I just blindly assumed they were doing their jobs until I tried Soap & Glory’s Body Polish where I noticed an immediate difference after the first time. The scrub consists of sea salt, sugar, shea butter and apricot seed oil. This scrub felt softer and smoother in my hand, as I pulled some out of the jar. It didn’t separate and was easy to spread around my skin. It felt like I was not only sloughing away dead skin, but also getting a moisturizing boost (thanks to the shea butter).</p><p>When I stepped out the shower, I felt like I had already put a layer of moisturizer on. Plus, the sweet, rich smell of Soap & Glory’s Original Pink Fragrance followed me. This blend smells of rose, bergamot and citrus. It’s not overwhelming, but it smells like you just got out of an expensive spa treatment. It’s so calming.</p><p><span class=s1>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

Other times, I’ve felt like I smelled a like Bath & Bodyworks—in a bad way—after inadvertently mixing so many scented shower, hair and body products. And every single one that I’ve tried is hydrating, so I’m definitely a convert.</p><p>I overhauled my entire bathing routine with Soap & Glory. I’ve also spotlighted a few other products that I think are buying in tandem with the body polish.&nbsp;Select Soap & Glory products are currently buy one and get one <a href=# rel=nofollow>40 percent off at Ulta</a>, so now is the perfect time to stock up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/soap-and-glory-clean-on-me-1.png><h2>Clarifying Shower Gel</h2><p>While most body washes strip your skin of its natural moisture while removing dirt and the day’s grime, <a href=# rel=nofollow>this body wash</a> is so hydrating.
