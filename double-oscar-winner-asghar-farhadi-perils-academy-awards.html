I just don’t know when,” he says in Farsi through an interpreter on a visit to Hong Kong. “And I don’t think the political relationship between Iran and the US or the UK would have an impact on that decision – I don’t really think about all that.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The Sisters Brothers director Jacques Audiard on being the French Scorsese</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Once a really good story pops into my head and I decide to make a film about it, I would do it. I wouldn’t think about the side issues.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Indeed, he wasn’t put off by the challenges of filming Everybody Knows, his first Spanish-language film, in Spain.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Farhadi, 46, who won his first best foreign language Oscar in 2012 for his humanistic masterpiece A Separation, was in Hong Kong recently to attend the Hong Kong International Film Festival and introduce Everybody Knows, his eighth feature film.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Set in Spain’s wine country, the film’s lead actors are real-life couple Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem, who have now worked together on nine films. In Everybody Knows, they play Laura and Paco, former lovers who are reunited at Laura’s family home for the wedding of her younger sister.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Laura’s teenage daughter (Carla Campra) goes missing on the night of the festivities, the film turns into a kidnap drama.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Almost everyone in the household becomes a suspect as family secrets and long-forgotten grudges are revealed, having built up since Laura moved to Argentina and married Alejandro (Ricardo Darin) many years earlier.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While the premise of this psychological drama, with its revelations and shifting perspectives, is unmistakably Farhadi territory, the writer-director was initially hesitant about the project.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/04/04/ab5b6264-545c-11e9-a3ae-f2742b367090_1320x770_022712.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When I started thinking about the plot and I started reading it to my family, my daughter pointed out to me that it looks like About Elly,” he says, referring to his acclaimed 2009 film of that name. About Elly also makes use of a disappearance to shine a light on its characters’ complex, capricious and often contradictory intentions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Farhadi initially put the idea aside to make The Salesman, set in contemporary Iran, before returning to it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I actually thought it might be a good idea to replicate the same experience from About Elly in a different culture. If we have the same type of situation in a different culture, how would the other characters react to it? It is the same situation here, but the reactions of characters in About Elly were completely different from these Spanish characters. This situation was interesting for me,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/04/04/dbb104f4-5458-11e9-a3ae-f2742b367090_1320x770_022712.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Everybody Knows is the second film Farhadi has shot outside Iran – after 2013’s The Past, which was filmed in Paris and primarily in French, and stars Berenice Bejo and Tahar Rahim alongside Iranian actor Ali Mosaffa.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I do prefer to make my films in Iran – even though, sometimes, going outside of Iran and working in a different culture is like a new experience,” Farhadi says. “I get to know all about their cultures through filmmaking. But once we have started shooting a film, I have the same feeling, whether we’re in Spain, in France or in Iran.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Everybody Knows is also the first film Farhadi has made without any Iranian characters or Farsi dialogue.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In The Past, there was still an Iranian character in the story. But this time, I told myself that I don’t need any help [from an Iranian context] any more. I want to do it my way. I wanted to have the experience of plunging into deep waters without having a life jacket,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/04/04/fb10ae02-5459-11e9-a3ae-f2742b367090_1320x770_022712.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Working abroad allows Farhadi to show aspects of life that are off-limits in his home country. In Everybody Knows, for instance, there are Catholic imagery, scenes of alcohol consumption and candid discussion of infidelity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When you work outside Iran, there’s no such thing as censorship,” he says, referring to the country’s Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. “You are free to put into practice whatever you think of.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But there is also a paradox here: even when you can work on issues that are not related to your own culture, you can’t just go and do anything. Even when I make films outside Iran, I still look to touch upon topics that are similar to those in my culture.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/04/04/48cebe78-5454-11e9-a3ae-f2742b367090_1320x770_022712.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ironically, the restrictive climate for filming in Iran has been a blessing for Farhadi. While he has regularly won awards since making his feature debut, Dancing in the Dust, in 2003, it is films shot in Iran that have earned the best reception from international critics and fans. A Separation remains the highest-grossing Iranian film in history.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is true,” Farhadi says when the pattern is brought up. “Naturally, the non-Iranian audiences would prefer me to make films back in Iran, because they think they could get to know Iran by watching these films. So I would try to make the majority of my films back in Iran rather than in other countries. But sometimes, I do feel that I need to experience and do something that is unexpected for others.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There is another point that I would like to make,” he adds. “Everybody Knows is only my second experience in a non-Iranian context. But A Separation was the fifth one made in Iran. The comparison between these two films might not be right.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/04/04/ecef1d4c-545c-11e9-a3ae-f2742b367090_1320x770_022712.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When it’s suggested we should expect a major hit with his fifth non-Iranian film, Farhadi laughs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Maybe. We don’t know,” he says. “But there’s always phobias for a director who steps outside his own country and make films in a different country.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even as he says this, Farhadi is in talks to shoot another film overseas – which would be the first he hasn’t also scripted – as well as one set in Iran for which he is writing the screenplay.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I don’t know which one I will go with [first],” he adds.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Actress Joan Chen on Hollywood inclusivity, Chinese films and new movie</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Occasionally, his mind turns to the two Oscars he has won, and to how they could ruin his craft.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The Oscar wins have definitely influenced both my personal life and my professional life,” Farhadi says. “That said, I do always try to be the same director that I used to be before getting these awards.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“While the awards are very good for [the marketing of] the films themselves, they could also be dangerous for their directors, who might lose their way afterwards. I always think about this and I always try to remain cautious.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Everybody Knows opens in Hong Kong on April 4.</p>Want more articles like this?
