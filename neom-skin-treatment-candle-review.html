One thing I never imagined doing, however, is spreading warm candle wax on my body with the hopes of achieving supple skin, but alas, here I am.</p><p>Before you assume that this skincare-candle hybrid is a product of kink culture or a sexy Valentine’s Day gimmick, hear me out, because apparently skincare <a href=# id=auto-tag_candles data-tag=candles>candles</a> are the latest thing in the beauty and wellness space. I’m guessing you’re either intrigued or horrified at this point, so I’ll go ahead and get on with my <a href=# rel=noopener>Neom Organics Skin Treatment Candle Review</a>.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/anua-cleansing-oil-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg><p>To offer some much-needed context here, I’ve been a huge fan of Neom’s luxe candle range for some quite some time now, but I have to admit — when I stumbled upon their Skin Treatment Candle, I was a little hesitant — not to mention kind of confused. But, in the name of beauty (and my job, of course) I figured I had to give it a try for myself. Spoiler alert: it’s not scary, painful, or <a href=# rel=noopener>kinky (unless you want it to be, that is)</a> at all.</p><p>In fact, it’s the ultimate me-time selfcare product I’ve been subconsciously dreaming into existence for the past year (I mean, let’s face it: we all could use a little extra TLC after the dumpster fire of a year that was 2020.)</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

Clearly, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Neom’s Skincare Treatment Candle</a> isn’t formulated with any old candle wax. The soybean oil base is infused with not only twenty-four different <a href=# rel=noopener>de-stressing essential oils</a>, but also a slew of nourishing skincare ingredients, including jojoba oil, <a href=# rel=noopener>cocoa butter</a>, almond oil and rapeseed oil.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0028/2568/3008/products/Real_Luxury_Intensive_skin_candle_box_and_product_750x750.jpg><h2>Neom Organics Intensive Skin Treatment Candle</h2><p>It probably goes without saying, but this candle also happen to smell like straight-up heaven on earth — i.e. lavender, jasmine and Brazilian rosewood.</p><p>Full disclosure: while I was ever-so-slightly concerned about getting burned, rest assured, it wasn’t an issue. In fact, this is one of the most relaxing nights to myself I’ve had in a hot (pun intended) minute. Neom recommends that you make a night of it too — draw a warm bath, <a href=# rel=noopener>pour a glass of wine</a>, and get ready to have the literal <a href=# rel=noopener>softest skin</a> ever after massage in the moisturizing oil and breathe in the relaxing blend of anxiety-erasing aromas.</p><p>Neom offers two versions of their Skincare Treatment Candle: the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Scent to De-Stress</a> and the <a data-pmc-sp-product=7237d7b22f62422a80be13f312628c76 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Scent to Sleep","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"NEOM - Perfect Night\u2019s Sleep Intensive Skin Treatment Candle | Lavender & Jasmine | Nourishing with Essential Oils | Perfect for Massage","price":"48.00","id":"B010OL3XAS","category":"Kitchen & Dining Features"},"id":1190491,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Scent to Sleep</a> . I tried the de-stress version, and as someone with an apparent inability to fully unwind, I found that it really did the trick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/neom.jpg><h2>Neom Organics Perfect Night’s Sleep Skin Treatment Candle</h2><p>For all of the restless night owls out there, it’s time to give this <a data-pmc-sp-product=2bcd3463e6fae22165831332903ddfea href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"sleepy time candle a try","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"NEOM - Perfect Night\u2019s Sleep Intensive Skin Treatment Candle | Lavender & Jasmine | Nourishing with Essential Oils | Perfect for Massage","price":"48.00","id":"B010OL3XAS","category":"Kitchen & Dining Features"},"id":1190491,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>sleepy time candle a try</a> .
