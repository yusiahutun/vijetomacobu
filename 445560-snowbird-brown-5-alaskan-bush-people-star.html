The show follows the Brown <a href=#>family</a> as they strive to survive in the wilderness. Here are some facts you need to know about Birdy.</p><h3>1. Snowbird Brown is a Scorpio</h3><p class=align-left>Snowbird Brown was born Amora Jean Snowbird Brown on November 18th, 1994, in Alaska, United States. Her horoscope is Scorpio. Scorpios are strong, enigmatic, and independent characters.</p><p class=align-left>She is the daughter of Billy Bryan and Amora Larene Branson. Unfortunately, her father died on February 7th, 2021, after suffering a seizure at 68. His death was a massive loss to the <i>Alaskan Bush People</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/86b7736e9ebaea1e.jpg><p class=align-left>Amora Jean is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">attached to the nature</a> and bushes of Alaska. She has been fishing and hunting since she was a child and contributes to the family's food supply. It is unclear whether she attended a formal learning institution.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/45f1f79e07555c15.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tonie Perensky biography: career, movies, family, net worth</span></p></a><h3>2. Snowbird Brown has six children</h3><p class=align-left>Snowbird is the <a href=# rel=noopener>eldest child in her family</a>. She was raised alongside her six younger siblings. They both appear on the <i>Alaskan Bush People</i>, a show that follows the lives of their family members. Her brothers are Solomon, Gabriel, Joshua and Noah, while her sister is <a href=#>Rainy Brown</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Did Snowbird Brown have a baby? Amora does not have a baby, and she is also not married. However, she is an aunt and Godmother to Noah's son. Noah is married to Rhain Alicia, and they have a child called Elijah Connor Brown.</p><p class=align-left>Even though she has brothers, Amora has turned out to be a fiercely independent member of the family. She is like her mother, whom she is named after.</p><h3>3. She has misaligned teeth</h3><p class=align-left>What happened to Brown's teeth? Fans of <i>Alaskan Bush People</i> have a peculiar fascination with Snowbird's teeth. Unfortunately, the front row of her teeth are misaligned. This problem is easy to fix considering the advanced health care facilities in the United States.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/32406cce4f5097e5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Michele Carey biography: The life and times of the El Dorado star</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Her misaligned teeth have seen her receive backlash on social media. Many of the show's viewers have wondered why she hasn't fixed the teeth. A tweet read:</p>I love Alaskan Bush People, but can't they get Bird's teeth fixed? The poor girl shouldn't have to live with that snaggle tooth.<p class=align-left>So, did Snowbird fix her teeth? Unfortunately, she has not. Since her family has a strict policy of living off the land, she has probably decided she will not have her teeth fixed. Furthermore, having been raised far from city and civilisation, she feels uncomforting to modern lifestyle.</p><h3>4. Amora Jean Snowbird Brown is an animal lover</h3><p class=align-left>Amora Jean is an animal lover and prefers to spend her life with animal friends over people.

Living out in the remote wilderness can sometimes be isolating and lonely. Perhaps that is why she finds it better to have cats around her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a67b0fe2dea34767.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Barbara Bain: husband, daughter, net worth, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><h3>5.
