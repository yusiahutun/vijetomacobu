After headlines about her being "not pretty" and a bad actress made the rounds last week, she shrugged everything off and did what anyone would: wear a slogan T-shirt that showed everyone that she's staying above the fray. Deep in a carousel of images shared over the weekend, Sweeney showed a snapshot of herself in an oversized gray sweatshirt that said, "Sorry&nbsp;for having great tits."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Instagram/Sydney_Sweeney</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Good times and tan lines," she captioned the post.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Last week, producer&nbsp;Carol Baum, who worked on&nbsp;Father of the Bride&nbsp;and its sequel,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>said at an event</a>&nbsp;that Sweeney is “not pretty” and “can’t act” — and that her hit rom-com&nbsp;Anyone But You&nbsp;was “unwatchable.” Even with those comments, the film has&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>earned $219&nbsp;million</a>&nbsp;at the box office worldwide.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Daily Mail</a>, Baum made her comments during a panel in Pleasantville, New York.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“There’s an actress who everybody loves now: Sydney Sweeney. I don’t get Sydney Sweeney. I was watching on the plane Sydney Sweeney’s movie [Anyone but You] because I wanted to watch it," she said. "I wanted to know who she is and why everybody’s talking about her. I watched this unwatchable movie — sorry to people who love this … romantic comedy where they hate each other.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I said to my class, ‘Explain this girl to me. She’s not pretty. She can’t act. Why is she so hot?’ Nobody had an answer. But then the question was asked, ‘Well&nbsp;if you could get your movie made because she was in it, would you do it?'" Baum continued. "That’s a very hard question to answer because we all want to get the movie made&nbsp;and&nbsp;who walks away from a green light? Nobody I know. Your job is to get the movie made.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Amy Sussman/GA/The Hollywood Reporter via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sweeney clapped back, saying in a statement shared by&nbsp;Variety: “How sad that a woman in the position to share her expertise and experience chooses instead to attack another woman. If that’s what she’s learned in her decades in the industry and feels is appropriate to teach to her students, that’s shameful. To unjustly disparage a fellow female producer speaks volumes about Ms. Baum’s character.”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Baum's statement was shared,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>TMZ reported</a>&nbsp;that she is “already expressing regret over the whole thing” and “wishes she never would’ve made her original comments.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570rKbp52pYsC4scSnnLJlo6yyosDSoaCrrF2eu7TAwKCpmqVdbYN0g5Fwaw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
