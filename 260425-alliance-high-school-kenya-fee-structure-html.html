However, it took the intervention of missionaries to set up learning institutions like Alliance to educate ordinary Kenyans at the beginning of the 20th century.</p><p class=align-left>Alliance High School is located 22 kilometres from Nairobi's central <a href=#>business</a> district and is quite close to Alliance Girls High School.</p><p class=align-left>The famous learning institution has always been among the top-performing schools during the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exams.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0f9e5220460e76b4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>60,000 Rwandan Students Who Failed Exams to Repeat Classes as Govt End Automatic Promotion</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The most exciting thing is that Alliance was ranked the top school in Kenya from 1960 to 1985, creating a solid reputation as a centre for academic excellence. The school's motto is "Strong to Serve".</p><p class=align-left>Alliance high school Nairobi admits students from all over the nation. These students come in with different talents.

It is at this point that one chooses the school among other options.</p><p class=align-left>The cut-off point for national schools varies yearly based on performance, but if you attain 400 marks and above, you have a high chance of joining the school. The most important thing to note is that the Alliance High School entry marks for people from marginalized areas might be lower because of the hardships they undergo while studying.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs5hck0rqh2kn.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>World Teachers' Day: TSC Celebrates Kenyan Tutors Amid CBC Training Stalemate</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Therefore, you might score 380 marks in your KCPE and miss a slot, but someone from Mandera might score even lowers marks but secure an admission.</p><p class=align-left>Once results are announced and the form one selections are complete, you can go to the Ministry of Education <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">official portal </a>and download your admission letter.

According to government regulations, schools should charge a certain amount per year. The state then supplements this budget with an annual boost, as specified below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0f9e5220460e76b4.jpg><p class=align-left>The school administration is prohibited from authorizing any fee increment without the ministry’s directive upon request. Unfortunately, there seems to be a blatant disregard for the set boarding fee that schools should charge, with principals and administrators blowing the fee structures out of proportion.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1faf8f7bd7313750.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>India: 25 Million Locals Shut out Of Internet Access to Curb Cheating in Teacher Eligibility Exam</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This trend has been ongoing since 2007, which has seen several bright but poor students miss chances in the best schools because they cannot afford fees.
