He only appears at midnight, and you can ask him two questions if you said "Dear David" first,' Adam claimed she said. 'But never try to ask him a third question, or he'll kill you.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Adam was confronted again with David in his dreams soon after and questioned him about how he died, learning it was an accident in a store that saw someone push a shelf onto his head.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He mistakenly asked a third question before waking up petrified. He researched online looking for boys who died in stores in the city but found nothing.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Adam eventually moved into a larger apartment upstairs from his own and months went by without any sight nor sign of Dear David until suddenly his cats began acting strangely.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'For the past four nights, my cats gather at the front door at exactly midnight & just stare at it, almost like something is on the other side,' he said in tweets from earlier this month.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Last night I got a weird feeling and looked out the peephole, and I'm dead certain I saw movement on the other side.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He took photos through the peephole, which he shared with the thread claiming he is 'certain' he saw something moving. He also shared a video of one of his cats staring intently at his front door.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A few weeks later, Adam began another thread explaining various strange things that have been happening to him, including a dream 'where David was dragging me by the arm through an old abandoned warehouse.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He woke up with a large bruise on his arm, but assumed that it was the injury that sparked the dream, rather than the other way around.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But then on his way to get coffee he passed a usually busy warehouse that had suddenly been abandoned. In the middle of the room was a single green chair.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He also revealed that faint 'faces' have been appearing in photos he has taken and that his cats' nightly date with the door has become earlier every night.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Adam also claimed that he had been getting phone calls from an unmarked number and when he answered once he heard the noise of static before a small voice whispered 'hello.' Terrified, he hung up the phone.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I didn't know what else to do. I closed all the curtains in my apartment and turned on every single light.&nbsp;I watched TV until dawn because I was too scared to go to sleep. I sort of feel like I'm losing my mind,' said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Adam then returned to update followers on his story, revealing that he had installed a home surveillance system in order to keep an eye on his cats when he goes on a trip to Japan in three weeks.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It's basically a nanny cam that connects to the wifi, so you can check in whenever you want. It runs 24/7,' he explained, before adding that the camera actually sends an alert to his phone whenever it detects movement in his apartment.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I decided to test it out this weekend. I was away from home one night, so I set up the camera before I left,' he went on to say.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'My phone pinged periodically through the evening, alerting me to the cats running around and playing. Normal stuff.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But then things took a turn for the creepy—once again.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Around 11, it alerted me again that it detected motion, but when I checked the feed of my apartment, I didn't see anything,' he wrote, before going on to reveal that after checking in on the feed three times, he actually spotted a green chair in his apartment ricking back and forth on its own, sharing the video of the feed on his account so people could see the extraordinary moment for themselves.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I knew it couldn't be the wind, because I haven't had the windows open at all this summer (I have AC and like to keep it chilly),' he said, before admitting that he found the entire episode 'unnerving' but that he was doing his best 'not to panic'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Half an hour later, however, he received another alert, and this time he checked in on the feed immediately. Much to his horror, the clip from the camera showed a souvenir turtle shell that was mounted on the wall above his bookcase suddenly dropping off the wall.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Although he says he has been too nervous to turn the camera on again, he admitted that he moved the green chair into the hallway, and that he was struggling to keep his cool while in his apartment alone.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His final tweet of the evening informed followers that he was 'taking a xanax and going to bed', before he signed off for the evening. &nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Unsurprisingly, Adam's ghost story has proved a riveting read for many users, and the first tweet of the thread has been shared more than 55,000 times while attracting plenty of ghost-fighting advice from strangers including 'finding the remains' of the child and 'burning them' or spreading salt around his apartment.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In September, Adam shared a spine-chilling update with the followers of his living nightmare in another Twitter thread.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It's happening again,' he wrote, before beginning to describe the latest twist in the terrifying tale.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I've been leaving the nanny cam on 24/7. It records every time there's movement or sound, as you know,' he added, referring to the amateur surveillance system he set up shortly after the ghostly activities began to take place.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>These cameras had already been used to capture footage of several objects - including a chair - appearing to move on their own inside his home when he was not there.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>ADAM ELLIS' FIRST GHOST STORY</h3><img id=i-d3be2e0425a96317

class=mol-para-with-font>The clips were taken in Adam's living room, while he was sleeping in his bedroom nearby.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Initially, he drew his followers' attention to the behavior of his two cats in the clip, particularly his black and white feline, Maxwell, noting that after 'a few moments', the animal suddenly 'freaks out and jumps over something invisible'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But while the video certainly captures his cat's rather peculiar movement, Adam's followers were far more horrified by a seemingly-innocent green class sitting on his coffee table, which appears to move several inches over, seemingly by itself, just after the cat starts leaping around.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I shrieked out loud when I saw it. This is TOO MUCH,' one terrified Twitter follower admitted, while another added: 'I'll be at Church reading the bible covered in crystals [and] saging myself if you need me.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But Adam wasn't done there. He went on to reveal that the camera had recorded 'a couple more strange videos' that same night, noting that they specifically picked up Maxwell sitting up suddenly on his hind legs, as if he had caught sight of something.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He'd sit up on his hind legs and peer around the room, as if looking for something (or looking at something?),' Adam wrote on Twitter, before sharing another video of his cat bizarrely sitting up on the sofa, before batting at something invisible in the air with his paw.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Although Adam admitted that it could possibly be a fly that Maxwell was trying to take down, he claimed he 'honestly never gets flies' in his home, adding that it therefore 'seems unlikely' - however he didn't dare to suggest Dear David by name, noting only that he 'can't shake the feeling something has made its way into the apartment'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He signed off the installment of his twisted ghost story by admitting that he just couldn't explain what was going on in his home, but suggested that he felt no more confident about being there than he did at the end of his last viral thread.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6GyboGQcG1taWNkjqWtzGZ8paSZqHq0tMCrnKxloJ6wtcHRnqpmfJWWv26QwK%2BgnWWSmrGzu86mZaGsnaE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
