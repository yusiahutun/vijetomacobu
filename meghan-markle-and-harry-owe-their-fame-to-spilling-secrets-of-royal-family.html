Since then, their life in Montecito, California has been carefully monitored by the media. Their highs and lows have all made headlines over the years. Now a PR expert is sharing his opinion on <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and Prince Harry’s Hollywood career. The expert explains that the former royals failed to capitalize on their peak fame. The expert further states they gained fame just by spilling the royal family’s secrets.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-853837928-1024x775.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-s-popularity-has-nosedived-in-2023>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s popularity has ‘nosedived’ in 2023</h2><p>A poll shows that Meghan and <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>‘s popularity has nosedived in 2023. While the Americans empathized with the Sussexes when they first came, they don’t still hold the favor of the public.</p><p>The Express <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">notes</a>, Harry’s memoir Spare further hastened their downfall in America. A recent polling by YouGov shows Harry was liked by 52 percent of American citizens in the last quarter of 2022, but that dropped to 46 percent at the start of 2023.</p><p>On the other hand, Meghan stood at 38 percent in the last quarter of 2022. That has dropped to 36 percent at the beginning of 2023. Then comes the premature end of Sussex’s $20 million deal with <a href=#>Spotify</a>. There are also reports of their <a href=#>Netflix </a>deal hanging by a thread. Their ‘near catastrophic car chase’ controversy in New York also contributed to their infamy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-1342064257-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-expert-says-sussexes-owe-their-fame-to-royal-family-secrets>Expert says Sussexes ‘owe their fame’ to royal family secrets</h2><p>The PR expert Royal McCormick weighed in on Sussexes’ fame and said they owed their popularity to spilling royal family secrets.</p><p>“These two individuals are most well known for spilling the secrets of the Royal Family (to which they owe all their fame and wealth),” he said.</p><p>The expert also says that Meghan and Harry did not capitalize on their momentum very well. He suggests they should have launched a Spotify podcast, a <a href=#>fashion</a> line, and more right when they had the peak interest of the public.</p><p>“If they had capitalized on the momentum during peak interest with the launch of their Spotify podcast (which they blundered), a fashion line, some type of educational membership course, or something similar; Harry and Meghan could have attained a higher level of prestige or at the very least, maintained their level of celebrity,” McCormick says.</p><p>The expert says that now people have lost interest in Meghan and Harry. They are reportedly moving on to the “next spectacle.” As per the expert, <a href=#>Hollywood</a> is also taking a cue from the dwindling public interest.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2aFcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55kmqaUYrWivtGyZKivlWLBqbHIq2SfmZ2aerW7jKynoqScnruoedKemqudpKh6sLKMq6aymZxis6K5yKWwaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
