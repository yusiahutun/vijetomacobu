So he did something incredibly generous: He got them all an all-expenses paid trip to the premiere.&nbsp;</p><p id=eh7QhFFX7GV1 data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Keanu Reeves pays sweet tribute to his roots in Canada's Walk of Fame acceptance speech</a></strong></p><p id=elJ794HuhpVB data-wc=59>The 57-year-old shelled out all the money for flights and hotels, making sure the stunt workers, crew and those who helped him on set during the sequel's filming were accommodated on private jets and with swanky rooms, according to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. The publication reports he also bought them premiere tickets and even set up a brunch for the next day.&nbsp;</p><p id=eacyHdlC9mOy data-wc=15><strong>WATCH: Keanu Reeves pays tribute to his past in Canada's Walk of Fame acceptance speech</strong></p><p id=eioGyhMYSr5u data-wc=26>"He flew a bunch of us up here," <strong>Chad Stahelski</strong>, the director of the John Wick movies, told the publication as he walked the red carpet.</p><p id=eqPAShsiQOOq data-wc=43>"He's incredibly generous. In the audience tonight will be so many people that helped him, from his martial art trainers to jiu-jitsu trainers to hair and makeup to his stunt crew.

He's epic."</p><p id=eqLeJ14sUgaY data-wc=53>Keanu also reportedly got the stunt team on the&nbsp;Matrix Reloaded crew their own Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and was also said to have bought those who worked on John Wick: Chapter 4's extra luxurious Rolex Submariner watches, according to The Hollywood Reporter. (If you're wondering what the latter retail for, they start at $10,500.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a65d36396d01-keanu-reeves-carrie-anne-moss-lana-wachowski-a.jpg><p id=eZfj2Sj62pRo data-wc=17><strong>Keanu with Matrix co-star Carrie-Anne Moss, left, and director Lana Wachowski, centre.

He runs the Keanu Reeves Children Foundation, which helps kids in the United States who are dealing with challenges such as poverty. He previously ran a similar foundation that didn't have his name connected with it, and has also donated to cancer research.&nbsp;</p><p id=esFZ4YzmJNXo data-wc=52>He's also wonderful to his fans. In 2001, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>he bought ice cream in Australia just so he could sign the receipt</a> for <strong>James Dator</strong>, who worked in a movie theatre as a teenager at the time. He's also been seen doing simple, every day things, such as <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>giving up his seat on the New York subway</a> for those who are carrying heavy loads. You can see him doing just that in the video above.&nbsp;</p><p id=e6MeSGb2yLAX data-wc=18>We're happy to hear about this act of kindness from Keanu, and would expect nothing less from him!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yRa2dqaWFmgHGBl2tmpJ2Ro8JuvsSerZ6rXZyyr7HRqKysZZees7V5wqucsGWWlrqquNhmnauhlaOxtHnMmquroahivbOxzKKcq51f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
