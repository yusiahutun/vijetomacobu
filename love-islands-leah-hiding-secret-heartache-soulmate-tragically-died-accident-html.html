It depends on the person and the situation but I am a very adaptable person, I know how to read the room.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="tvshowbiz-ccox mol-style-bold">DO YOU FALL IN LOVE QUICKLY?&nbsp;</span>Real love, no. I can fall in lust but I don't fall in love quickly. My big thing is trust, I've got to trust you fully before I can give you my heart. I won't give you my heart for free, you've got to earn it.</p>&nbsp; <img id=i-78ed6892e269425 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/07/19/00/72734419-12135629-Lochan_Nowacki-a-11_1689721741191.jpg height=284 width=284 alt="Lochan Nowacki" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Lochan Nowacki</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold tvshowbiz-ccox">NAME:<span class=mol-style-bold>&nbsp;</span></span><span class="mol-style-bold home-ccox">Lochan Nowacki</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold tvshowbiz-ccox">AGE:</span>&nbsp;25</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold tvshowbiz-ccox">FROM: </span>Windsor</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold tvshowbiz-ccox">OCCUPATION:&nbsp;</span>Account Manager</p><p class=mol-para-with-font></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold tvshowbiz-ccox">WHY ARE YOU EXCITED TO GO INTO CASA AMOR?</span>&nbsp;I feel like I’m excited because a lot of the people in relationships aren’t fully secure. I know the type of person I am as well, so I feel like I can turn heads. I’m not going to be disrespectful and I’m proud of my morals as a person. I’m confident that I can go in and not necessarily stir it up, but open the ladies’ eyes to what could be a better couple.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="tvshowbiz-ccox mol-style-bold">HOW DO YOU PLAN ON TURNING PEOPLE'S HEADS?&nbsp;</span>I have a top three in my mind already, so I’ll probably be pulling them for chats quite quickly and letting them know they’re the top three people I want to speak to. But I’m confident I’m a people person, I’m not going in there to act any differently to how I am with my own friends. I back myself that people will see that and see my good looks and bish, bash, bosh.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font></p><p class=mol-para-with-font></p><p class=mol-para-with-font></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmhramJogHODjoWmr51dfsCtrc2dqmaElZa1brTInaCnn12osqS%2BxK1koZ2Rp8Gir8eeZKynpaG6osDEZqurmZeesKK4y7JknaGVmXqir8Kim56mpGO1tbnL</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
