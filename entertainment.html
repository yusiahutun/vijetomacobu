Well, now that the film is finally here, we know exactly who’s who in the Spencer&nbsp;cast—and how they look versus their IRL counterparts.</p><p>For those who haven’t yet seen&nbsp;Spencer,&nbsp;here’s what to know about the latest Princess Diana film. Spencer, directed by Pablo Larraín, takes a close look at the late Princess of Wales’ final <a href=#>royal family Christmas</a> with <a href=#>Prince Charles</a> before their divorce. The film takes place across only three days—Christmas Eve, Christmas and Boxing Day—in the early 1990s, roughly around 1992, at the royal family holiday home of <a href=#>Sandringham Estate</a>. During these last few days of the year, the Princess of Wales realizes that her marriage with Charles is unraveling amid his <a href=#>affair with Camilla Parker Bowles</a> (the woman he would go on to marry years after <a href=#>Diana’s death</a> in 1997), and with it, so is her mental state.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/prince-william-kate-middleton-princess-diana.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/prince-harry-king-charles.png><p>While the film does not address Princess Diana’s death itself, it does foreshadow her decision to leave the royal family for good. As Kristen Stewart, who plays the Princess of Wales in the film, told late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel in 2020, “[Spencer] takes place over three days, and it’s this really poetic, internal imagining of what that might have felt like, rather than giving new information.”</p><p>Director Pablo Larraín, for his part, described Princess Diana’s journey in&nbsp;Spencer&nbsp;in an interview with Deadline. “We decided to get into a story about identity, and around how a woman decides somehow, not to be the queen. She’s a woman who, in the journey of the movie, decides and realizes that she wants to be the woman she was before she met Charles,” he told the site in 2020. “It’s about finding herself, about understanding that possibly the most important thing for her is to be well, and to be with herself and by herself. That’s why the movie is called Spencer, which is the family name she had before she met Charles. It’s very contained, set over a few days in Sandringham. They spent Christmas there for many years and that’s where we set the movie in the early ‘90s, around 1992, we’re not specific. It’s Christmas Eve, Christmas and Boxing Day, three days, very contained. We get to understand what it is she wants and what she will do.”</p><p>So, now that we have an idea of what&nbsp;Spencer&nbsp;is all about, let’s dive into what the&nbsp;Spencer&nbsp;cast looks like versus their real-life counterparts.
