With the judge signing off on the petition, the actress will serve as the sole trustee for her mother's estate and the sub-trusts for her sisters.</p><p>Riley&nbsp;and Priscilla also agreed to terms regarding Lisa Marie's half-brother, Navarone Garibaldi. Priscilla will serve as the trustee for his sub-trust, equaling 1/9 of the trust. What's left of the trust will go to Riley, Finley and Harper.</p><p>The court ruling comes after months of disagreement between Keough and her grandmother.
