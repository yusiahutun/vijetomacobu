It wound up being nothing, sort of a false alarm, but it was enough to really frighten me."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4123f23a-4ca8-482a-b7aa-9403e9559f0b data-container-ref=toofab:article:f8815277-a8fd-46c1-83b7-91a6c551c5d1 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b3/5by4/2022/05/24/b3af5da090404750997eab2176c979e9_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">CBS</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Tom Cruise Terrifies James Corden with Crazy Stunts in Top Gun Fighter Jet</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>She continued, "As a result I struggled with separation. I never loved flying, but it got worse the first time I traveled without her, that was the first time I had a real panic.

"I felt like I was in capable hands, I didn't worry for a moment about his skill as a motorcycle rider or as a pilot â€¦"</p><p>Although Connelly was not required to join Cruise and the other actors on an intensive preparatory bootcamp, the actress did learn to sail a boat which was integral to her character's passion for sailing.</p><p>"They wanted Penny to be able to hold her own with Maverick. She has a hefty dose of zest for life too," she said.</p><a id=gallery-link-e29464cd-5f23-45cb-b6c9-2eebb2c6572b class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:e29464cd-5f23-45cb-b6c9-2eebb2c6572b data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:f8815277-a8fd-46c1-83b7-91a6c551c5d1 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/43/4by3/2022/12/22/432fd20c1ce448c8b964bdb2d6651e42_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j29maWlfqbyxecaupWalkauys7XCpGSjnZ6jtqex0WaaqKaemrmtxYysmpqqlZl6sLKMn6OyoZ6ceqKy056pZpyRqrSpwMSrZKGdkaHBqXnSnJirnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
