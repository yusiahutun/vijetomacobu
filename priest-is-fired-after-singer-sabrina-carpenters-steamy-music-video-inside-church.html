Gigantiello was “relieved” of his position after Sabrina Carpenter filmed the music video for her song Feather at the Blessed Virgin Mary Church in Brooklyn.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1801110002-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-priest-loses-job-over-sabrina-carpenter-s-church-themed-music-video>Priest loses job over Sabrina Carpenter’s church-themed music video</h2><p>Two days after the video which, at the time of writing, has been viewed more than 12 million times, was released on <a href=#>YouTube</a>, Bishop Robert Brennan said in a statement <a href=# rel=nofollow>shared</a> with the Catholic News Agency that he was&nbsp;“appalled at what was filmed at Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church in Brooklyn.”</p><p>The statement continued: “The parish did not follow diocesan policy regarding the filming on Church property, which includes a review of the scenes and script.” Brennan is apparently going to look into the incident further, with the parish reportedly telling the diocese that the <a href=#>music</a> star’s production company “failed to accurately represent the video content.”</p><p>They report that it was Monsignor Gigantiello who approved of the filming, which took place both inside and outside the church, which was the reason that he was dismissed.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Megan Fox’s therapist said her pain would morph ‘into an illness inside her’ if she didn’t let it out</a></p><p>The church said that “a more thorough investigation will be made into the approval process in the coming weeks.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-contents-of-the-music-video>Contents of the music video</h2><p>The video for the single sees the former <a href=#>Disney</a> star dancing around the 19th-century church’s pews and alter in a black flowy dress. Other scenes see the <a href=#>celebrity</a> being catcalled and treated inappropriately by a number of men, who she then murders or who are killed by other means. The scenes in the church serve as their collective funerals.</p><p>Sabrina, who has been touring with <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, nor her management, has yet to release a statement on the matter, though the priest who was dismissed from his position has spoken out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-priest-s-facebook-apology>The priest’s Facebook apology</h2><p>On his Facebook page, the priest <a href=# rel=nofollow>apologized</a> for what had occurred. He explained he had researched Sabrina Carpenter but found nothing “questionable.” He continued by saying that he allowed for the filming in an&nbsp;“effort to further strengthen the bonds between the young creative artists who make up a large part of this community.”</p><p>The priest added: “I offer my sincere apologies to the Bishop, the Diocese, my faithful parishioners and all of you for this shameful representation, which I whole-heartedly renounce …</p><p>“While I take full responsibility for the erroneous decision to allow the filming, I want to assure you that I had no knowledge that such a scene would be filmed in our church which we worked so hard to restore to its present sacred beauty. I further affirm that a lapse in judgment such as this will never take place again, as I fully devote my every action to preserving the sanctity of the parish and faith community with which I am entrusted.”</p><p>Gigantiello claims he and other members of the church staff were unaware of certain elements that would be filmed, such as “the placement of faux coffins in the sanctuary.”</p><p>Monsignor Gigantiello said in an email that he was aware there would be funeral scenes, but that the final product was “not what was initially presented to me.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>ennifer Garner can’t keep it together as she realizes how many nuts are in her bag</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2eGcLzRopysrF2ewG6yyKucnWWRm8GmvoysoKeflad6tK3Bq6CnmV2YrrO8xKernqqjYsC1scCmsGalpai2pHnVopuep12eu7S1w55knKClp7Cpew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
