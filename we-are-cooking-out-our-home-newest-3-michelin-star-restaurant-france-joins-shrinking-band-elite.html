These were braised mackerel with beetroot and parsley foam and a crispy buckwheat dessert, made with caramel mousse, candied citrus fruit and sea lettuce sorbet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/08/ccfd0118-a28d-4f2c-9cf0-096224e4a324_220cd911.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is incredible because we are a really small restaurant cooking out of our home using fresh local ingredients,” said Couillon after the ceremony.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He and his wife took over his parents’ fish outlet in 1999 when they were 23 years old, turning a simple restaurant serving tourist fare in the summer months into a gourmet phenomenon open nearly year-round.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/08/bdca2acf-29e4-4481-85c9-5006a564ba0b_072832dc.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Michelin’s streamlining of the top echelons of French gastronomy was also marked by an increasing focus on regions outside Paris. Of 44 establishments newly awarded stars, 37 are beyond the capital city; several were also recognised with awards for best sommelier and pastry chefs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The four restaurants newly awarded a second star this year are in different corners of France, including L’Auberge de Montmin, which is set in Haute-Savoie, southeastern France, and L’Amaryllis, in Burgundy.</p>“More than ever chefs get their inspiration from the regions,” <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Gwendal Poullennec</span></a>, international director of Guide Michelin said during Monday’s ceremony, which featured three-Michelin-star chefs from across Europe.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Michelin shows that Malaysia is another country it has no place judging</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The event marked a return to normal for an industry ravaged by the Covid-19 pandemic, when restaurants first had to close, then find ways to recruit staff during a labour crunch and now grapple with food price inflation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">La Marine served affordable takeaway dishes such as fish and chips during the health crisis, using the same fresh catch from the sea and vegetables from its kitchen garden used in the creations that earned its Michelin stars, Couillon said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He begins every day at the local fish market, choosing products for a menu offered to just 20 diners for each service.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We have made a choice to source everything fresh. Nothing is frozen,” said Celine Couillon. “It would be impossible to move our restaurant because it reflects the place. We couldn’t do the same thing anywhere else.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">La Marine is “worth the detour” – the definition of Michelin’s three-star ranking – because “it sweeps us away to the island of Noirmoutier and leaves us forever changed” Michelin said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/08/2f9d5494-31ed-4c28-adaa-7ceb4eabf5ef_1013540b.jpg>Even before this year’s announcement of the star selection, the Michelin guide’s France rankings were making headlines. At the end of February, news broke that one of the country’s most famous chefs, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Guy Savoy, was being downgraded from three stars to two</span></a>. The fine-dining seafood restaurant Christopher Coutanceau in La Rochelle suffered the same fate.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The guide also removed Christophe Bacquié in Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur from the three-star list because it closed. A reopening with a new chef is planned.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This is the second year in a row Michelin has held its award ceremony outside Paris; last year chefs celebrated at an event in Cognac, southwest France. Organisers had to hold the event in the morning to avoid planned transport strikes set to snarl travel across the country.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/08/e79be904-b7eb-43e4-af17-21f1bdf6b32a_229b55a7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In total, 25 restaurants lost stars. Besides the two 3-star spots that lost their top ranking, three formerly two-star spots were downgraded to one star.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last year Plenitude, in the Cheval Blanc hotel in Paris owned by the luxury giant LVMH, garnered three stars within a year of its opening, a notable feat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This year there are four new two-star restaurants; last year there were six. One of them, Chateau de Beaulieu-Christophe Dufosse in Busnes, northern France, also got a prize for sustainability – a green star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/08/a58116ef-29df-4351-943c-bf064f8c5f69_02a3b8b0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 39 new one-Michelin-star restaurants in France include La Mutinerie in Lyons, Les Cadets in Nantes, Rouge in Nimes and Rozo in Lille. Mallory Gabsi, 26, who was a semi-finalist on French TV’s Top Chef, got a star for his eponymous restaurant in Paris and received the prize for best young chef.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Michelin guide has been around since 1900; in 1926 it began awarding stars. Since March 2022, it has ceased promoting restaurants in Russia as a result of the war in Ukraine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmm6uhnqB8or7TopqlnV9of3J%2BlnFoaK%2BVYq6zsYycpqijmaO0brvUrWSoraJitbC5xGalnq%2BVqMFuf4ymoJyglaG2r3nSrZirZaKawLWt1KuYp6xdm7%2BiusKeZKOnmaPAbr%2FHq6Cno5mjtG6uwKebZp2cnsGm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
