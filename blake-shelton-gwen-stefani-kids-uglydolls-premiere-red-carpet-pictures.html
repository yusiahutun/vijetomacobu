"The kids are super excited about this movie. I’m excited for them, because it’s such a great message."</p><p>Stefani has three with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale:&nbsp;12-year-old Kingston, 10-year-old Zuma and 5-year-old Apollo.&nbsp;In three-plus years of dating Shelton, they've rarely — if ever — stepped out as a fivesome in an official capacity.</p><p>“It’s a rare thing for Gwen and [me] to even get out at all," Shelton explains. "We don’t really get a chance to do anything. One of the two of us are working or the kids are in school — it just never works out for us to all go out. We get to do it about four or five times a year — this is one of them.”</p><p>In the UglyDolls movie, Shelton plays the one-eyed Mayor of Uglyville, Ox.&nbsp;His character has a huge secret he has kept hidden, and it winds up being revealed in the film.&nbsp;“He’s super ugly for one thing," he says of his character,&nbsp;speaking of how he relates to him.&nbsp;"He has a big belly hangin’ off him."</p><p>Not only is&nbsp;the country star one of the leads, but he&nbsp;also recorded a song for the movie's soundtrack, "Wallflower and Weeds."&nbsp;UglyDolls also stars fellow Voice judge <a href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a>&nbsp;portraying, the leader of the group who is searching for something more. Clarkson also sings "Today's&nbsp;the Day," "Broken & Beautiful" and "Couldn't Be Better" on the soundtrack.</p><p>UglyDolls hits&nbsp;theaters on May 3.</p><p><strong>See&nbsp;Pics of Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani and Her Boys at UglyDolls Premiere:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmm6SRoLJuv8eeo62nnmK0uLHNZqqtnZaWu6p5yqKbrGWlnLm6sM6lo6xloKeyrrXEq5xmqpWZeqSt0amcrWWgnrC1wdGeqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
