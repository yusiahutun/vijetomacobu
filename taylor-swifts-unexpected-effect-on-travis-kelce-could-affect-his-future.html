The American footballer participated in the <a href=#>TV</a> show Catching Kelce in 2016 where he dated one woman from each state in search of his ‘soulmate.’ While Catching Kelce could not ultimately help him find a soulmate, experts believe that <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>‘s company can help him change his playboy reputation once and for all.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1724942711-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-thanks-to-taylor-travis-kelce-can-be-focused-now>Thanks to Taylor, Travis Kelce can be ‘focused’ now</h2><p>American sports expert John Salley believes that Taylor can bring the biggest change in Travis Kelce’s career. The American former professional basketball player <a href=# rel=nofollow>commented</a> on how Travis can finally be focused and not worry about 100 direct messages as he pursues Taylor.</p><p>“He now doesn’t have to worry about 100 DMs,” adding “or making sure certain girls got tickets. He can be focused, right?” Salley also addressed Kelce’s apparent playboy status saying that talking to Taylor will lead him to have a simpler lifestyle. He gushed: “So, he has practice, go to sleep, talk to his girl. That’s easier than when you get to be the playboy that he used to be.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1701284358-1024x687.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-friends-of-travis-fear-heartbreak-for-taylor>Friends of Travis fear heartbreak for Taylor</h2><p>Taylor Swift has been spotted in not one but two games of Travis Kelce’s Kansas City Chiefs game and the second game saw a number of Hollywood A-listers <a href=#>celebrities</a> including Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Hugh Jackman.
