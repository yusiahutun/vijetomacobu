If your hair is damaged or brittle, consider using more gentle and nourishing options.</p><ul><li><strong>Coverage And Longevity</strong></li></ul><p>Check how much gray coverage the hair dye offers – this is especially necessary if you're looking to cover your gray hair. Long-lasting hair colors are also great since you don't need to maintain them regularly.</p><ul><li><strong>Brand Research</strong></li></ul><p>It's better to pick Korean hair dye brands that have a good reputation and are well-known. Take a look at the product's reviews too, to get a better idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Method of Application</strong></li></ul><p>Choose a hair dye that's easy for you to apply at home. The process should be simple and you should be comfortable, only then will you get the best results.</p><ul><li><strong>Additional Benefits</strong></li></ul><p>Look for features such as UV color protection and color-lock benefits. This can help keep your color looking fresh for extended periods,&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Allergies And Sensitivities</strong></li></ul><p>Check for potential allergens in the product, and once you receive it, perform a patch test before the full application.</p><p>Don't forget to follow all the instructions that come with the product carefully. If you still have any doubts, you can consult a professional hairstylist.</p><p><h2 class=title>Ingredients to Avoid While Buying a Korean Hair Dye</h2></p><p>While picking out a Korean hair color dye, it's essential that you stay away from harsh ingredients such as ammonia, parabens, and sulfates.
