It is striking how much of the majority’s reasoning would apply with equal force to the claim of a fundamental right to plural marriage.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>When asked about a plural marital union at oral argument, petitioners asserted that a State 'doesn’t have such an institution.' But that is exactly the point: the States at issue here do not have an institution of same-sex marriage, either.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Collier, 46, said that dissent inspired him. He owns a refrigeration business in Billings and married Victoria, 40, in 2000. He and his second wife, Christine, had a religious wedding ceremony in 2007 but did not sign a marriage license to avoid bigamy charges, he said.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Collier said he is a former Mormon who was excommunicated for polygamy and now belongs to no religious organization. He said he and his wives hid their relationship for years, but became tired of hiding and went public by appearing on the reality cable television show 'Sister Wives.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In the episode, the Colliers hosted the show's stars - the Brown family - at their home in Billings and discussed their polygamist lifestyles.
