To put things into perspective, no African knows his or her name is funny, especially their traditional names, until s/he gets a second opinion about the name from a friend or close associate. If anything, Africans understand their names as a family’s emblem and a title worn with pride, but not a reason to laugh; which makes things even more interesting.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/46919d562eb4c1b0.jpg><p class=align-left>Most Africans name their children based on the prevailing conditions at the time of birth. It is also common for them to name children according to what they wish for the child. This is especially so for Africans living in Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. However, with the introduction of English during the colonial time came a rather funny shift in the naming process. Initially, Africans had traditional names both the first name -according to the situation at birth or wishes of the parents towards the child, and their sir name, - which was mostly the family name.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2b51cac53e1b7c87.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Outstanding Meru girl names and their meanings that you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, with the white man’s, perceived, sophisticated language, English, came a sociological shift when giving a child his or her first name – from traditional name to an English name.

Here are some of the most hilarious <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">South African names</a>.</p><h3>1. Phelephe Matric Examsion</h3><p class=align-left>Following the initial logic of giving names to children, it is apparent that this fellow’s parents were optimistic about his academic pursuit and accomplishments.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/62ff31dbda1d0898.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Most popular Korean girl names with meanings</span></p></a><h3>2. Tsotetsi Pipinyana Pampoen</h3><p class=align-left>Judging from the difficulty of pronouncing this name it is safe to conclude that it is an absolute African name. It is a typical se Tswana name, one of South Africa’s native sub-tribes. The first name refers to male genitalia while the middle name is Afriikans name for pumpkin. You are excused if, by now, your mind is already wondering with the hope of understanding the inspiration behind this name.</p><h3>3. Ndlovu Two-Rand</h3><p class=align-left>Clearly, back in the days, Two-Rands could have bought you more than they can today. Gosh! What happened to the South-African economy?</p><h3>4. Sambu Victor Dont Worry</h3><p class=align-left>The meaning of this name is left to your imagination. But wait a minute, if victor stayed true to his second name he must be among the most laid back persons today.</p><h3>5. Amakali Immanuel Very Important Person</h3><p class=align-left>Whose parents wouldn’t node their head to the affirmative if this was their child’s name?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4bb3c4f574a3059c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is the longest name in the Bible?

If the names listed above are not good, then you need to manage your expectation because Kenyan funny names are just that; funny!</p><h3>1. Apoko Nyang’au</h3><p class=align-left>This is a popular Kisii name, which probably means well. However, for avid Swahili speakers, this name means a dirty dog or bloody brute. With people being lazy judges, this name is judged at face value, which often leaves people in laughter.</p><h3>2. Maskini</h3><p class=align-left>For a Kenyan, a Swahili speaker for that matter, giving such a name to your child is quite surprising. However, to the bearers of this name, Maskini is a symbol of pride worn with admiration.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5a1269eea7c3849c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>West African baby names and meanings</span></p></a><h3>3. Panyako</h3><p class=align-left>What do you have to say about this?</p><h3>4. Wamalwa</h3><p class=align-left>This is a popular Luhya boy name. Arguably, it is by far a hilarious name for a Luhya. It means that the boy child has been born during the brewing season.</p><h3>5. Mugeci</h3><p class=align-left>Mugeci is a lady who loves gossip. She comes as half Luhya and half Kikuyu. It is believed that only a Luhya or a Chef can wife her for reasons beyond my scope of wisdom.</p><h3>6. Nyambura</h3><p class=align-left>According to the Kikuyu tribe, Nyambura means born during the rain. To the Luo, Nyambura means a kitten. It is a word coined from Mbura, which means cat.</p><h2>Funny Zimbabwean names</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c9ced3af259b80f1.jpg><p class=align-left>If you are looking for a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Zimbabwean name</a> for your kid here are some that will lighten your heart each time you call the kid.
