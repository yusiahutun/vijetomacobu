The sinking exercise will be undertaken by warships from the navies of the various participants in the northern Philippines.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/17/b57e2814-f691-458d-b3ac-e9511832096c_41f777b4.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a briefing with the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines on Wednesday, Logico said this year’s Balikatan – a Tagalog term for “shoulder to shoulder” – would feature several firsts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At least 16,000 participants will train together this year, including 11,000 soldiers from the US and 5,000 from the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), while the rest will come from the French navy and the Australian Defence Force. The figure is expected to top last year’s number of 16,000 service members, who were mainly from the US military and the AFP.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fourteen other countries, including those from Asean, the European Union and Japan, would send “observers”, Logico said. Participants from other government agencies such as the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Information and Communications Technology were also invited.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Logico said this year’s exercise would test the interoperability of the AFP’s service commands with foreign forces and, for the first time, allow them to “showcase the comprehensive archipelagic defence concept” that was recently announced by Defence Secretary Gilbert Teodoro.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The concept would pivot the AFP from internal to external defence, or from fighting a local insurgency to battling a foreign enemy, Teodoro had said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/17/bb5c33b4-6ef5-415a-8e80-39fda725fe66_fc6b2aba.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Besides the sinking of a vessel, another Balikatan highlight is a logistics exercise that involves testing the feasibility of transporting the US Navy’s SM-6 missile system by air.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Logico said the three-missiles-in-one system was “normally fired from a destroyer” but the US found a way to make it a land-based missile using a “prototype launcher”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He stressed that the SM-6, which has a 300-nautical mile range, would not be fired at all during Balikatan. “We are testing the feasibility of bringing this weapon system by air and offloading [it] into a secure and established space.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When asked by This Week in Asia whether the SM-6 would be located in range of the Second Thomas Shoal – a contested maritime landmark in the South China Sea that is 105 nautical miles from Palawan province – Logico said it would be located in northern Philippines, far from Palawan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/17/0bb28821-1bca-490b-befd-6dd76dd5f943_19ebaadb.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Elements of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) will also join the Balikatan for the first time this year. Logico said they would “secure our exercise areas, particularly during the maritime strike exercise” to make sure “there will be no interlopers … who are entering the training area, for their safety of course”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The PCG has been at the forefront of guarding resupply ships to Manila’s military outpost on the Second Thomas Shoal – where a World War II era navy vessel, the BRP Sierra Madre, was intentionally grounded to strengthen Manila’s territorial claims on the surrounding waters – and has consequently had several run-ins with Chinese coastguard forces that have attempted to disrupt those missions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Its participation was “absolutely not” militarising the coastguard, Logico said, adding that the maritime exercises involving the PCG assumed a situation which had evolved from normal day-to-day operations into “armed conflict”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/17/aff9c053-abbb-45ff-b8fc-867d056d9859_0e2b32ed.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The group or multilateral sail, involving the Philippine, US and French navies, would for the first time take place beyond the 12-nautical-mile maritime territory of the Philippines, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“An intrusion into our exercise area is a possibility, but that will pose more of a problem for the people who want to enter the exercise area, not us,” he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As the multilateral group sail would be conducted inside the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone, which is 200 nautical miles from its coastline but beyond the country’s 12-nautical-mile territorial waters, the presence of the foreign navies “could be explained as freedom of navigation operation”, Logico said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Logico stressed that the Balikatan exercises were not directed at any foreign country, including China. “With or without China … we would still be doing these exercises. Because these are things that nations do.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Philippines prepared for ‘worst-case scenario’ as South China Sea tensions rise</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Logico said the armed forces had a mandate to defend Philippine territory. “And there is an adjunct to that mandate, which is that you have to train for it. And for realistic training, we train in areas where realism is provided for,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There’s no sugar-coating this. The purpose of armed forces, why we exist, is really to prepare for war … For us not to prepare, that’s a disservice to the country.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For this reason, the exercises will include scenarios in which islands are retaken from a foreign enemy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The exercises will also, for the first time, give “equal importance to both the physical and the non-physical domains” such as cyber defence. The “cyber domain has far-reaching implications into the physical domain, especially the way … our weapons systems fully rely on the cyber domain for [them] to work”, Logico said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If, for example, “somebody were to mess with your GPS”, certain things would be “beyond difficult” to do.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2wuMitoJyrX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2JqhnSElGiZmqSZoK61rc1mpKKkmamus8WMnamipJyoerG0yKWgqaiZo7K0edKasKxlo567rLXNoGScoJmjrm65wJ2cZquYnr1uus6tZKKmpJq7tbXOp5il</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
