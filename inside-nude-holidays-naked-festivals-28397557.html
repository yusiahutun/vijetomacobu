However, it seems attitudes are changing across the nation as millions of people declare they love to get their kit off - including a rise in nude holiday options.</p><p>A poll taken by British Naturism recently found that 14% of British adults – that’s 6.75million people – would describe themselves as <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>nudists </a>or naturists. an increase of 8% since the last figure was taken in 2011 meaning we might be becoming more European in our attitudes towards nakedness.</p><p>Against the usual assumptions it also seems that the younger generation are getting involved in nudism as 47% of young people under the age of 24 said they’d been naked around others.</p><p><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>READ MORE: 'I throw insane Benidorm stag dos – my partner strips and I serve nuclear drinks'</a></b></p><p><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow><b>Read all the latest stories from the Daily Star's travel team</b></a></p><p>Dr Mark Bass, President of <a href=# rel=nofollow>British Naturism</a>, said: "Attitudes to nudity are changing with taboos and stigma being eroded. Modern society is weighed down by a body confidence crisis and more and more people are discovering the benefits that nudity brings to mental, emotional and physical health by allowing us to reclaim ownership of our identities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28397637.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_Woman-near-sea.jpg><p>"When we spend time naked with others we realise that we all have scars and flaws, and that we don’t need to compare ourselves with an airbrushed model. Naturism gives us the freedom to be ourselves and have a lot of fun." In terms of travel, nudist holidays and experiences are also on the rise – we take a look at some options below...</p><h3>Yoga Retreats in the buff</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30753837.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_7a788bb6-25c2-4117-977e-19a29f7b830fjpeg.jpg><p>Matt, the bearded naked yogi, <a href=# rel=nofollow>@thebeardednakedyogi</a>, is runs a <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>nudist yoga retreat</a>. Set in Fuerteventura, Matt took 10 men who like to bare all while twisting themselves into forms and shapes at a nude resort.</p><p>The naturists get up to all sorts, starting the day with a full naked yoga session followed by afternoons in the town or swimming nude on the local beaches which are nudist friendly.</p><p>Matt explained: "We tend to have the first yoga lesson in the morning around 8am and then breakfast is laid out for them by a chef. There’s a huge amount of stuff for them to do – surfing, windsurfing, shopping, some are getting their nails painted.</p><p>"By the time they come back lunch is ready for them. Then in the afternoons there’s free time – the guys have enjoyed the beaches here. One night we took dinner down to the beach, they had a couple of bottles of wine to share and we did a short yoga practice on the beach before dinner. But, sand is a very unstable surface and we were falling over all covered in sand having a great laugh. We were completely naked and we ran into the sea and had a good swim before the meal."</p><h3>Winter sun without clothes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31394250.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_KJ_bar.jpg><p>Karie Jane, from the UK, runs a naturist resort in Fuerteventura, a Spanish hotspot in the Canary Islands where the sun always shines, nudity is welcome and flights are £25. She says the Spanish island is like <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>the "Hawaii of Europe".</a></p><p>Karie Jane, from the UK, opened BHH Nudist Resort in Costa Calma, <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Fuerteventura</a>, after converting her holiday home which she originally owned with her ex-husband. She says that naturism is "liberating" but not sexual "on any level" – and can be enjoyed all winter in the Canary Islands.</p><p>She said: "Fuerteventura is a popular choice for naturists seeking winter sun because of our mild and pleasant climate, with temperatures mostly staying above 25 degrees meaning it is an ideal destination for people wanting to sunbathe and enjoy outdoor activities without their clothes when the UK is in the grip of winter. And its only a four hour flight away."</p><h3>Nudist cruise</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28397649.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Nudist-cruise.jpg><p>The <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Big Nude Boat trip</a> runs each year. The naked ship’s journey will include several "fun nude days at sea" before heading to St Thomas, St Kitts, Antigue, Grand Turk, Amber Cove, Princess Cays and Half Moon Cay. The Caribbean islands will require clothing, but while on-board the ship passengers are welcome to forego their clothes. The Carnival Pride ship will also offer some nudist days while on land.</p><p>The Cruise Bare website states: "The highlight of the cruise will be our exclusive visits to the private beach resort of Princess Cays and a day at the beach at everyone’s favourite private island of Half Moon Cay in the Bahamas. These two days of nude sea, sun and fun will be a return to bare-adise."

Nudefest brings together daytime activities and nightly entertainment.</p><p>Some of the fun from the 2022 Nudefest included body painting, dance classes, clay pigeon shooting, archery, drum workshops, arts and crafts and choir meetings.
