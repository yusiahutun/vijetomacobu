While the model already had plenty to offer at an affordable price, it'll now come with two big upgrades, all for the same low price.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lately, we've started seeing eBike manufacturers put bigger battery options in bikes, which is exactly what we're getting from Ride1Up. According to <a href=#>Electrek</a>, Ride1Up recently updated the Core-5 with a substantially larger battery. To keep up with the competition, for the same low <a href=#>$1,195 starting price</a>, the new Core-5 now has a 25% bigger battery.</p><p>The updated Core-5 from Ride1Up offers an improved range by boosting the battery to a 12.8Ah cell from the previous 10.4Ah. As a result, owners can expect around a 25% longer range from the bike. That said, it's still in the same location on the bike, mounted on the lockable downtube, and integrated into the frame.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Velotric Discover 1 E-Bike Review: An Affordable, Comfortable Cruiser</a></span></p><p>And finally, it looks like Ride1Up is shipping the bike with a built-in LED headlight. These days, we're seeing more bikes come with a light out of the box rather than an optional add-on, so it's great to see the Core-5 get this upgrade.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the Ride1Up Core05 eBike, you'll enjoy fast speeds of 20mph with the throttle or over 28mph when combined with pedal assist. Only now it'll have a headlight and more range thanks to the bigger battery. Both upgrades come at no additional cost, as the new and improved bike retails for the same $1,195 price.
