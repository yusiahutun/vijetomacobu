Many traditional large employers in Hong Kong, including retail businesses, had to shut down due to the pandemic, leaving a large number of the labour force unemployed.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Barclays Summer Academy, a four-week employability programme, supports ethnically diverse young people into work. Colleagues in Hong Kong have been supporting this programme with their time and skills for the past six years. When the pandemic struck, Heidi Lee, a Barclays employee, along with Vandelra Kwan, helped pivot this programme to be delivered virtually. The Zubin Foundation identified participants that needed support, and the programme was delivered successfully throughout 2020 and 2021.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“With Barclays’ support for the programme, there has been a discernible positive shift in the mindset of the young people we work with.
