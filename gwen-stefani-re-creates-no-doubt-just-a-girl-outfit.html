The look, composed of a cropped white tank top with red and blue stripes, and baggy blue track pants, was finished off with a pompadour ponytail and bright red lipstick.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"U ready for my new single?" Stefani wrote in the caption. "ðŸŒŸ gx #LetMeReintroduceMyself."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This isn't the first time that Stefani has treated fans to a nostalgic throwback to her No Doubt days. The 51-year-old singer also recently revealed on Instagram a new cover art image that shows her personal evolution. On the cover, Stefani, dressed in the red, white, and blue "Just a Girl" ensemble, points toward a more modern iteration of herself dressed in risquÃ© black fishnets and thigh-high boots.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9D7gMh0tEk" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="On The View" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">On The View</a> last year, Stefani talked about where her songwriting prowess came from while penning "Just a Girl," which has since become a feminist anthem, saying, "When I wrote the song, I was just so naÃ¯ve. I literally hadn't even written very many songs," she said. "I didn't even know who I was. â€¦ I wrote this song because I feel like I was just getting in touch with that feeling. When you're born, if you're a female, you just don't think about it, you're just a human. â€¦ And then through life, you sort of start to realize, 'Oh, someone just whistled? What does that mean?' You get this power through your sexuality, but then you're vulnerable at the same time because all of a sudden you're a victim."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She went on, "You have all these awarenesses as you're getting older, and I just wanted to write a song about that. I thought the idea of 'just a girl' is sarcastic. I never thought anyone would hear the song or that I would be sitting here talking about it all these years later. But I feel proud of it."<br></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
