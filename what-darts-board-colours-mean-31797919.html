Assorted double and treble sections are green and red, as are the bullseye (red) and the outer bull (green). Single number sections are split between white and black.</p><p>But why is that? Well, the origins of the board's colour scheme can be traced back to its early design. Darts boards in the present day are made from sisal fibre, which are the strands from a cactus.</p><p><b><i>What do you love most about darts?

Gradually, more colour was introduced to make them more appealing and to enhance the experience.</p><p>It is believed that the red and green colours – the most striking on the board – were originally intended as a nod to British history and culture. Red is associated with the Tudor rose, while green is related to the House of Lancaster.</p><p>Plus, while there's historical context to the colours on the board, they also allow players to focus. The Treble 20 segment is one of the most important on the board, and the one that players will aim for most.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31798164.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Paddy-Power-World-Darts-Championship-202324-Day-Fifteen-Alexandra-Palace.jpg><p>The fact it is coloured in red makes it easier for players to focus on as they throw their dart.
