In fact, the 62-year-old actress said she would be open to strolling down Wisteria Lane once more should the series get the reboot treatment.</p><p>“You know, I had so much fun on that show,” Dana revealed exclusively to Closer Weekly at the Off-Broadway premiere of Alice By Heart in NYC on Tuesday, February 26 when asked about the prospect of its return. “Unexpectedly good fun. So yeah, sure.”</p><p>Desperate Housewives ran for eight seasons, from 2004 to 2012, and garnered 38 Emmy nominations, seven of which were wins. In the past, both <a href=#><strong>Eva Longoria</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Williams</strong></a> have exclusively told us that they’d be down for a reboot as well. But while <a href=#><strong>Teri Hatcher</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jesse Metcalf</strong></a> have voiced support for a reboot, others — like <a href=#><strong>James Denton</strong></a> — have their doubts that it would work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dana-delany-desperate-housewives-cast.jpg><p>Dana, a two-time Emmy winner, starred as Katherine Mayfair on Desperate Housewives beginning with season 4 through season 6 until she ultimately reprised her role in the series finale. As for where she stands with her former costars, it seems though Dana is still pals with the ladies — some more than others.</p><p>“I do actually,” Delany replied when asked about keeping in touch with the gang. “I’m in contact with <strong>Marcia Cross</strong> (Bree Van de Kamp) all the time. We’re friends.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dana-delany-marcia-cross-desperate-housewives.jpg><p>Desperate Housewives fans will recall that Dana and Marcia’s characters were both fierce and fabulous ladies who, despite always being in quite the heated rivalry, started a catering business together. Dana noted that people still talk to her about the show but, more specifically, they ask her about Katherine and Bree’s relationship and say they wanted them to “get together as a couple.”</p><p>As for the lasting impact of Desperate Housewives, Dana doesn’t think that legacy will ever die out — reboot or no reboot.</p><p>“I don’t feel like it’s gone away because there’s always some person on Twitter talking about it,” Dana gushed about its staying power. “There’s a lot of young girls that watch the show over and over again, so I don’t think it will ever go away.”</p><p class=p1>For more exclusive content, sign up for our Closer Weekly <a href=#>newsletter!</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46dnKyolaeutbGMoaauq5Wstrex0mapnpqfpMFusMCnmGaclaGur8WMoqpmp6Cau26yzqtkrKCfrMBuvsStrKumXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
