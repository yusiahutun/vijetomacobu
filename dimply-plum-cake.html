I don’t <i>want</i> summer to be almost over. I don’t <i>care</i> that I love fall; I love even more not having to wear jackets and toe-covering shoes and <i>socks</i>. I hate socks most of all. Everyone knows that fall is abundantly short-lived and all of a sudden you’re catapulted into the longest, winter ever, and …</p><p>I’m not ready.</p><p><a title="one-bowl cake" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50140092773_5e88e654a9_n.jpg alt="one-bowl cake" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="smooth the batter" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50140634166_cb2ac327e0_n.jpg alt="smooth the batter" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="halve and remove pits" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50140634006_a2a327a738_n.jpg alt="halve and remove pits" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="ready to bake" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50140090098_c7435c1e37_n.jpg alt="ready to bake" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="from the oven" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50140091533_f21433fce8_n.jpg alt="from the oven" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="dimply plum cake" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50140870022_c067b3acbb_n.jpg alt="dimply plum cake" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>And yet, there’s something happening in our kitchen that subverts my insistence that summer must not end.

It also comes together unbelievably quickly, as in Jocelyn texted us at 5 p.m. last weekend to come over for a barbecue, just as we were getting home from the beach, we put it together in no time flat, it baked while we showered and we were up on her roof for <a href=#>one of the best sunsets of the season</a> before 8 p.m.</p><p>It was gone almost as quickly, which means you can’t say you weren’t warned about the power of the Dimply Plum.</p><p><span style=font-size:medium><strong>Note:</strong> This cake got some fresh photos and in 2020 It originally looked like this:</span></p><p style=text-align:center><a title="dimply plum cake" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/3195/2781743578_26ed4cf6da.jpg alt="dimply plum cake" width=500 height=332 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h3 class="p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn" itemprop=name>Dimply Plum Cake</h3><ul class=jetpack-recipe-meta><li class="jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield" itemprop=recipeYield><strong>Servings: </strong>9 to 16, depending on how you cut it</li><li class=jetpack-recipe-time><strong>Time:</strong> <span class=time>1 hour</span></li><li class=jetpack-recipe-source><strong>Source: </strong><a href=#>Dorie Greenspan's Baking: From My Home To Yours</a></li><li class=jetpack-recipe-print><a href=#>Print</a></li></ul>This is a wonderful coffee cake–sturdy, comes together quickly, and absolutely perfect for this time of year. It would also work with several other kinds of fruit, including apricots, peaches, nectarines or even cherries. You can swap the orange zest for lemon, lime or even grapefruit and the spice too. (Dorie suggests apricots with orange and a bit of star anise, cherries with mint, peaches with lemon and some fresh basil, and so on, so have fun with it!)<p>This recipe got a light update in 2020; I now make it one-bowl. I also realized that if your plums are large, you will not fit 16 halves on the cake — I was only able to fit 9… So, you’ll want either 8 small/medium plums or 5 medium/large ones. When you shop, look at the diameter and estimate how many could fit across an 8-inch pan. This cake might taste a little dry on the first day, but hits its stride — moist with an excellent crumb — on the second and third days.</p><ul><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>5 tablespoons (70 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>3/4 cup (packed) (145 grams) light brown sugar</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>2 large eggs</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/3 cup (80ml) flavorless oil, such as canola or safflower</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>Grated zest of half to 1 whole orange (to taste)</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>2 teaspoons baking powder</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom or cinnamon</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 1/2 cups (195 grams) all-purpose flour</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>8 purple or red plums, halved and pitted [see Note about size]</li></ul>Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter an 8-inch square baking pan, dust the inside with flour, and tap out the excess.<p>Beat the butter at medium speed until it’s soft and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add the sugar and beat for another 3 minutes, then add the eggs, one at a time, and beat for a minute after each egg goes in. Still working on medium speed, beat in the oil, zest and vanilla; the batter will look smooth and creamy, almost satiny. Sprinkle baking powder, salt, and cardamom over batter and beat well to combine, 20 seconds longer than seems necessary. Add flour and mix only until incorporated.</p><p>Run a spatula around the bowl and under the batter, just to make sure there are no unimxed spots, then scrape the batter into the pan and smooth the top. Arrange the plums cut side up in the batter — depending on your plum size, you’ll be able to fit 9 or 16 plum halves on the top. A Jiggle the plums a tad just so they settle comfortably into the batter.</p><p>Bake for about 35 to 45 minutes, or until the top is honey brown and puffed around the plums and a toothpick inserted into the cake between each plum comes out batter-free. Transfer the cake to a rack and cool for 15 minutes during which time the plums juices will seep back into the cake then run a knife around the sides of the pan and unmold the cake. Invert and cool right side up.</p><p>Once cool, I dusted mine with powdered sugar. You can wrap the cake and keep it at room temperature for up to 3 days, during which time it will get softer and more moist.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-540 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-540 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
