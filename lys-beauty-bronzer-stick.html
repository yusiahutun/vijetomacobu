It’s a never-ending cycle, but this one <a href=# id=auto-tag_bronzer data-tag=bronzer>bronzer</a> stick caught my eye. <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>LYS Beauty’s No Limits Cream Bronzer and Contour Stick</a> has gone viral thanks to <a href=# id=auto-tag_meredith-duxbury data-tag=meredith-duxbury>Meredith Duxbury</a> and <a href=# id=auto-tag_mikayla-nogueira data-tag=mikayla-nogueira>Mikayla Nogueira</a>. And now, the rest of TikTok has joined in on singing its praises.&nbsp;</p><p>It all started with @<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">meredithduxbury</a> posting a GRWM video where she chats with her viewers about her signature foundation technique. The TikTok garnered 9.9 million views, with fans quick to ask Meredith about the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$20 bronzer</a> she used. The content creator literally had to post a second <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video</a> to rave about the product (and that one got 9.3 million views). Fans were blown away by how easily her bronzer blended out. So, let’s dive in.&nbsp;</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>Meredith explains that she first taps the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">No Limits Cream Bronzer and Contour Stick</a> onto her skin with a brush and follows that up with a beauty blender. The initial harsh lines of <a href=# id=auto-tag_contour data-tag=contour>contour</a> suddenly disappear and turn into one seamless, snatched canvas for the rest of her makeup. The TikToker calls it “pure magic,” and after watching both videos, I completely understand.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>I get it even more after watching @<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mikaylanogueira</a>’s TikTok, which has amassed 7.3 million views. “That is ridiculously creamy. Holy crap, how do they do that? How do they do that in a stick form? It like turns into like a liquid when it touches the skin,” says Mikayla. “It’s extremely easy to blend this out. It just melts into the skin. I get it, Meredith.”</p><p>Coming in five different shades (two of which are sold out at <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Sephora</a> right now), LYS Beauty’s viral bronzer stick is clean, talc-free, vegan, gluten-free and cruelty-free. It’s also, as Mikayla pointed out, incredibly creamy and blendable. As its product name would suggest, you can use it as both a bronzer and a contour to sculpt and define your complexion.&nbsp;</p><p>The ingredients that allow the bronzer to apply smooth like butter and make your skin look so sun-kissed include rosehip oil, green tea extract and sodium hyaluronate. So your skin is not only going to look amazing, but it’s going to feel amazing, too. Antioxidant-rich <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rosehip oil</a> helps fade dark spots and moisturize the skin, while <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>green tea extract</a> calms. To top it off, <a href=# rel=nofollow>sodium hyaluronate</a> hydrates and plumps alongside <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>niacinamide</a>, which controls oil production.</p><p>If you’ve been searching for a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bronzer</a> that makes your skin warm and glowy rather than patchy and dry, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">No Limits Cream Bronzer and Contour Stick</a> is about to become your new best friend.</p><p>For just $20, heck yeah, you’d better at it to your Sephora cart! After all, Meredith and Mikayla can’t say enough good things about the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">bronzer and countour stick</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2hpZmWFdYKSaKOyq12XsqLB07Jkm6qfo8emvoysq6Kbm2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
