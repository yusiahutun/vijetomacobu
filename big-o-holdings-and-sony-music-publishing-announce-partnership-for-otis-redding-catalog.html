Known as “The King of Soul,” Redding debuted with Pain In My Heart in 1964, featuring his first hit single, “These Arms of Mine,” which reached No. 20 on the R&B charts and was prominently featured in the hit film Dirty Dancing.</p><p>Redding’s catalog includes other major hits like “Respect” (famously covered by Aretha Franklin), “Try A Little Tenderness,” and “Hard To Handle” (covered by the Black Crowes). He co-wrote “(Sittin’ On) The Dock Of The Bay” with Steve Cropper, released posthumously in 1968 after Redding’s death on December 10, 1967. The song topped the Pop and R&B charts and won two Grammy Awards in 1969.</p><p>A native of Macon, Redding’s influence spans genres and generations, inspiring artists like The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Jay-Z, and Willie Nelson. He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1994 and honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999.</p><h4>Statements from Key Figures:</h4><p><strong>Mrs. Zelma Redding</strong> expressed her confidence in the partnership, stating, “For over 50 years, I have been diligent in ensuring Otis’ legacy remains relevant and recognizable around the world. I feel that the Sony Music Publishing team can assist my family in this never-ending effort.”</p><p><strong>Jon Platt, SMP Chairman/CEO,</strong> remarked, “As one of the most significant songwriters of our lifetime, Otis Redding remains an American treasure. Otis’ songs have shaped the cultural landscape across genres and generations, and it is a privilege to partner with the Redding family as stateside custodians of this singular music catalog.”</p><p><strong>Brian Monaco, SMP President and Global CMO</strong>&nbsp;added, “Otis Redding was a rare talent – his songs are unmistakably brilliant, and their enduring impact remains strong to this day. We are honored to join forces with the Redding family to represent his catalog and strengthen his legacy as one of the most iconic songwriters in American history.”</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4FwfJRoaWlnkp60bruMoaalnJmjtLR5wKebZqufo8ZuudSsoJxloKqvrbXSoaCnn12Wu6%2B71KeanmWglr%2B1usSrqqGhoGKzsL6MqKuiq12nsqWwyKeeZpuRqa6tu8Zo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
