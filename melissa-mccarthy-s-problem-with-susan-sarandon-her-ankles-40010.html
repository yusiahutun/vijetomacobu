There seems to be a hold up?’ And they said, ‘Susan looks too good.’</p><p>“And I was like, ‘Oh, is it pretty lighting, do we both look too good?’…’No, just Susan.'” Melissa explained. “Susan seems to be glowing from within.”</p><p>Tammy, which opens in theaters July 2, isn’t the first time the comedienne and her husband have worked together. They also appeared together in Identity Thief, Bridesmaids and The Heat.</p><p>Watch a clip from Melissa’s interview on Jimmy Kimmel below!</p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZr1UsiU5dA</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mnKWho6iubrnCnJirrJiuerR5z6umm6SVonq4tdOhZKyto5a7br%2FAq5innJ%2Bjeqmx0WaYp6OcmsBugI9paGln</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
