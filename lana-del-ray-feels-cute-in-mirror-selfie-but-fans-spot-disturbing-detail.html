Followers have joked the ‘Grammys made her mad’.</strong></p><p>The 38-year-old recently joined her <a href=#>celebrity</a> pals at one of the biggest events of the year. Lana Del Rey attended the <a href=#>Grammys</a> as she was up for five nominations for her recent album Did You Know That There’s A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd. However, Lana Del Rey fans were upset she was ‘snubbed’ at the Grammys because she didn’t walk away with any accolades. Despite being nominated a total of 11 times, she’s never taken home a golden gramophone. Now, the <a href=#>music</a> star has uploaded a new selfie on the social media platform which has some fans at ease, and others laughing.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lana-del-rey-poses-with-gun-on-instagram>Lana Del Rey poses with ‘gun’ on Instagram</h2><p>The New York native took to <a href=#>Instagram</a> to share new photos of her posing in a cute white dress. The mini-dress had puffy shoulders and a huge bow at the front.</p><p>This was something that follows her inspiration for her Red Carpet look for the music even last week. She was hailed as one of the best <a href=#>fashion</a> statements of the night. She wore a black lace dress and embraced the coquette bow trend.</p><p>Lana wore her hair up in a loose up-do, where strands of her brunette locks fall out, as well as what looks like a beaded bracelet on her left arm.</p><p>But it was the fact Lana Del Rey was holding in what appears to be a gun in her right hand that caused a stir.</p><p>Some fans thought it was a joke and a fake firearm, quipping: “Oh the Grammys made her MAD”.</p><p>A second added: “Get your Grammy back.”</p><p>Then, a third said: “Girl, finger off the trigger.”</p><p>She captioned the post: “Felt cute”. In the second image, she announced she was headlining Coachella this year. This will be alongside Tyler, The Creator, <a href=#>Doja Cat</a>, No Doubt and Blur. Although, there’s no evidence it’s real.</p><p>The United States Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms under the Second Amendment, and a third of adults are <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a> to own a firearm.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lana-snubbed-at-the-grammys>Lana ‘snubbed’ at the Grammys</h2><p>Many fans felt the pop star didn’t receive justice at the awards show. She was up for album of the year alongside pal and collaborator <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>.</p><p>But Taylor was named the champion for the big award for her 10th studio album Midnights, and pulled Lana up on stage with her. This is because she sang on one of the singles on the record and Taylor wanted to celebrate with her.</p><p>Another blow to the celebrity was how <a href=#>Jack Antanoff,</a> music producer to Tay-Tay and Lana, won an award for his work – on her album. Sheesh.</p><p>After, the hashtag, Justice For Lana, was trending as many felt she deserved to be recognized for her work. Some even thought they could see her <a href=#>‘keeping her composure’</a> after looking upset she didn’t win.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2WFcLjAp5hmnJWherOt2Gadnp2cqHqkwdOeZKKmXaK2s77Oq2SsnZybtqZ5wa6rZp6Ro8Buv8%2Boq2acmajBtr7BoqWgZZSawaK1y2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
