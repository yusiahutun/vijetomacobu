Having attended a matinee of a play that the then 19-year-old Kevin was acting in, Kyra's brother encouraged her to go and tell him how much she'd enjoyed the performance, so she did.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/fb1620b3f9a2-kevin-bacon-kyra-sedgwick-relationship-timeline-1.jpg><p id=ecFNjBZ3mKjV data-wc=71>However, the couple only truly met ten years later when they were both working on the 1987 PBS film adaptation of the play . By this point, Kyra was – hilariously – <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>far less enamored</a></strong> with her future husband. "He definitely wasn't my type," Kyra reminisced during a <strong>&nbsp;</strong>magazine interview in 2008. However, the two did eventually end up connecting and getting together following their time on the project.</p><p id=ewVbi06IsB6z data-wc=85>Since meeting on set, the couple have starred in several more projects together such as , and – the latter of which was a real family affair as it was produced and directed by Kevin and starred Kyra and <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>their two children</a></strong>. The couple care a lot about <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>supporting good causes</a></strong>, which fittingly links to one of their first appearances together as a couple – which was at an AIDS benefit revue in New York City in April 1987.</p><h2><strong>When did Kevin and Kyra get engaged?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/0265740b9b4d-kevin-bacon-kyra-sedgwick-relationship-timeline-2.jpg><p id=eYJQX1SLkhLV data-wc=87>Kevin proposed to Kyra on Christmas Eve 1987. The actor revealed this story in an interview with PopEater (now Huffpost) in 2010: "I put the ring in the toe of the stocking… Shockingly, she said yes!" the 64-year-old said. But although the couple's love was strong, their engagement <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>wasn't without its troubles</a></strong>. Several months after his proposal Kyra confessed she didn't like the ring. "We were lying in bed and I woke up and she [was] crying," Kevin told Kelly Clarkson on her show.</p><p id=e9EgqL-Rm1zJ data-wc=54>"I was like 'what's happening?' I wondered if she was breaking up with me," he continued, before adding: "She finally says 'I don't like the ring!'" The couple eventually patched up the awkward moment by returning the actor's original choice and replacing it with a different ring which Kyra still treasures to this day.</p><h2><strong>When did Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick get married?</strong></h2><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Twitter</a><p id=exAIQ9p9jx7g data-wc=40>The acting icons tied the knot on September 4, 1988, during <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>a private ceremony</a></strong>. In her 2008 interview, Kyra admitted that in retrospect, the pair barely knew each other when they tied the knot, despite how close they felt.</p><p id=ey-SnfQdmyak data-wc=81>"When I look back at our first four years... by that time we'd had our second kid, and I look back at those pictures and I think:&nbsp;'Gosh, I didn't know him at all!'&nbsp;I loved him, but I didn't know him, and he probably didn't know me. But you grow together and learn more about each other," she revealed. And it's clear the couple made a success of this seeing how they remain married and very close to this day.</p><h2><strong>Are Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick still married?</strong></h2><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Kevin and Kyra celebrate their anniversary with an adorable duet</figure><p id=e7KhE0c1Yv20 data-wc=56>Yes, as discussed, Kevin and Kyra's relationship is beloved by fans as the sweet couple have been together now for <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>over 35 years</a></strong>!

No one can stay together,' I get really irritated. I don't think our relationship is more or less difficult; I just think you both make the commitment and you make it work."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/3eead6556d83-kevin-bacon-kyra-sedgwick-relationship-timeline-3.jpg><p id=eVSTBBdFph7W data-wc=55>Speaking about how the couple deal with the struggles of married life, Kyra told the same magazinein 2008: "We always knew that we were each other's 'one.'
