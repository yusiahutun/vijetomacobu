Any one of those injuries could have caused her death.</p><p>Prosecutors say cases involving this type of "overkill" usually stem from a personal rage against the victim by someone the victim knew intimately.</p><p>Tonya Miller and Jabaris, her only child, told police they didn't know what happened to the victim.</p><p>Mobile phone records showed that 33 calls where made on the victim's mobile telephone to friends and family of the Millers within two days of the victim's disappearance, former Fulton County police homicide detective Glenn Kalish testified.</p><p>Mobile phone towers depicted a path of those calls from Florida to Georgia.</p><p>Rucker told jurors that the victim had previously gone to a court in Florida to get a protection order against Tonya Miller, who had threatened her.</p><p>But the two women reconciled for a while, until the victim finally called off their relationship, pawned Tonya Miller's belongings behind her back and changed the locks to the Tampa home they shared.</p><p>He told jurors the two women likely talked one last time in Tampa, with the victim agreeing to give Miller and her son a ride to Georgia.</p><p>But along the way, the women argued and the Millers ganged up on Miranda, killing her and putting her body in the back of her white pickup truck, he said.</p><p>Witnesses told police they saw Jabaris Miller, who had never owned a vehicle, driving a white pickup truck after the victim disappeared.</p><p>After police confronted him, Jabaris Miller confessed to driving the victim's body to a secluded area about half a mile from his mother's apartment and dousing the truck and body with petrol.</p><p>He told investigators he didn't think the victim would mind if he borrowed her truck because she wasn't around.</p><p>He said he noticed her body in the back of the truck under a tarp on March 3, 2005, but was scared to tell police. The next day, he torched the body and truck.</p><p>His lawyer, Wes Bryant, told jurors his client is guilty of arson and concealing a death but he insisted that prosecutors had not proven who killed Miranda or if she was killed in Fulton County or elsewhere.</p><p>Tonya Miller's lawyer, Gary Guichard, said her son made all of the phone calls on the victim's mobile phone and there is no proof his client even shared a ride with the victim and her son.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWKCcoOTb3BohZ%2Bptaa%2BjKymp2WTna6zs8SdZJuqpamurXnMrqmdnaJiuaa%2FwaKYp2WcpMOmvo2hq6ak</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
