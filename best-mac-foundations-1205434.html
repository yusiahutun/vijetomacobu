For a dewy, matte, or glossy look, the first step is to invest in one of the best MAC foundations, the OG of makeup products. A good foundation will set the overall tone of the makeup but if your foundation does not match your skin tone or oxidizes too soon, then you’re giving fashion disaster a free pass into your life. Austrian beauty blogger Lizzie&nbsp;says, “Foundations come in different forms, there’s BB cream, powder foundation, tinted, foundation stick, and a bunch more but the most common type of foundation is the liquid one. Depending on your skin type, you can find different formulations.”</p><p>The purpose of the foundation is to provide your skin with a flawless appearance, the degree of which can vary from person to person. While some people may like to wear their foundation to mimic a no-makeup look, others might want to go all out and create a makeup look that enhances their existing complexion, giving them medium to full coverage. Whatever the purpose is, MAC cosmetics has a foundation for every skin and every need.

It's a multi-purpose cosmetic item that makeup lovers have yearned for. It can be used on the face and the body with ease using fingers, a brush, or even a sponge. You'll save big bucks by buying one product that can work on both. The foundation is also easily customizable as it has a water-based formula, which feels incredibly lightweight and appears sheer on the skin but also gives effortlessly buildable coverage. Additionally, it works just as well on oily, sensitive, or acne-prone skin and doesn't even clog pores. MAC Face & Body is fantastic for people of all ages, works wonders on wrinkles, and is ideal for dry skin, but it also works wonders on oily skin when used in conjunction with setting powder.</p><p>Pros</p><ul class=pros_list><li>Natural look</li><li>Lightweight</li><li>Multiple uses</li><li>Suits all skin types</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul class=cons_list><li>Sheer but buildable</li></ul><p><h2 class=title>How to Select the Correct MAC Foundation Shade?</h2></p><p>Be absolutely clear regarding your skin type; if necessary, see a dermatologist. Seasoned makeup reviewer, Lizzie, thinks that liquid foundation is believed to be the best for people with dry and combination skin. “It is popular because it glides on easily and provides the most amount of coverage. <a href=#>Stick foundations</a> can sometimes be tricky to cover all parts of the face while <a href=#>powder foundations</a> are the classic type that works like a compact, as well as a foundation. It is easy to retouch and is a great perfecting powder. These work best with oily skin as they double up as blotting paper and just tap out the oil.”</p><p>It is always preferable to choose MAC foundations from a store outlet rather than from online shade charts because you risk becoming confused and picking a shade that does not match your tone. Furthermore, MAC stylists can quickly identify your shade and undertone and fix you up with an apt shade. Be aware of your true skin tone and undertone before purchasing MAC foundation. There are a lot of options even among in-between shades, so MAC truly understands your skin, don't settle for anything lesser than a true match.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Apply MAC Foundation</h2></p><p><strong>&nbsp;-</strong>Use a brush with densely packed soft synthetic fibers for a smooth, even finish of the foundation. This makes blending and buffing thick liquids and creams simply. It eliminates the risk of getting a patchy look. A quality brush can make the difference between a face that looks airbrushed and a&nbsp; makeup look that looks like you did it in a rush.</p><p>-Once you have picked the right foundation brush or beauty blender that does not absorb too much product, apply some primer or strobe cream of your choice.</p><p>-Now, it's time to paint the canvas! Just pump a pea-sized amount of foundation (or just a bit more) at the back of your hand. Using a brush, start applying the foundation on your face in slow, gentle strokes.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;-</strong>Use a brush with densely packed soft synthetic fibers for a smooth, even finish of the foundation.

Good lighting is essential because nobody wants their foundation to have a flaky or rough finish. A bright white light bulb in your bathroom is a great fallback option in cold winters when the sun sets earlier than you would want it to. Natural daylight from a window will also work. Avoid using yellow or cozy fluorescent lighting at all costs!</p><p><h2 class=title>How Long Does a Mac Foundation Last?</h2></p><p>Although it might seem like the toughest task in the world to throw away your favorite lipstick or foundation, it's crucial to follow makeup expiration dates.“The ingredients and formula are going to start to change and if you apply these products to your skin they could cause chemical burns, breakouts, skin irritation, and issues that's why it is essential to pay attention to how long you've had a product," Canada-based Skincare expert, Ashley says.&nbsp;</p><p>But here's the tricky part--The use-by date on your makeup products, however, is dependent on the first day you use them rather than the date of purchase, unlike the contents of your refrigerator. If you ever find yourself in doubt, all products have a tiny symbol that resembles a jar with a number or letter on the inside that denotes the PAO, or period after opening. The product's shelf life after opening is indicated by the numbers that come before the letter M. Often these foundations typically have a shelf life of six months to a year. Even though the foundation can last for a few years if it isn't opened, it is best to replace it after six to twelve months if the seal has been broken.</p><p>"Especially if you have sensitive skin, you should keep a close eye on your products. In case the expiry date is not available, every beauty product will have a batch code number which you can use to call the company and they will be able to tell you when that product was manufactured, or you can use the website called Cosmetic Calculator which will do the work for you," adds Ashley.&nbsp;</p><p>Another tell-tale sign of expired formula is a foul smell or change in its appearance. Separation is yet another indication that liquid or creamy foundation is long past its prime. Therefore, the next time you notice an immiscible layer forming in your foundation, don't shake the bottle for reuse; simply discard it. You can also prolong the shelf life of your foundation by ensuring minimal contact of your fingers from the neck of the bottle or tube.&nbsp; Also, keep foundations away from high-temperature and damp areas (like your bathroom), as these conditions encourage the growth of bacteria and hasten the spoiling process.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Keep in mind that choosing the best MAC foundation for you will depend on your skin type, skin tone with undertones, coverage, texture, and finish. Before spending your hard-earned money on MAC foundations, consider these attributes carefully because every skin– dry skin, oily skin, or combination–is unique in its own way. A few trials and errors and normal when trying out new makeup products, but when you find your makeup elixir, we’re sure you’ll rock the world!</p><h2 class=title>FAQ's</h2><p>What are the best MAC powder foundations?</p><p>Some of the best MAC powder foundations include Studio Fix Powder Plus Foundation and Mineralize Skinfinish Natural.
