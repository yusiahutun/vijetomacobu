After all, when Michelle, 35, married her former star and radio host partner <a class=hm-link href=#>Mark Wright</a> in 2015 she did go for a rather unforgettable 60s-inspired look that we just can't help but come back to. As we approach wedding season brides face the decision of how to style their locks which is why we have enlisted Luke Benson to help.</p><p id=eNlXkJZOJmb data-wc=114>Celebrity hairstylist <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Luke Benson</a> has worked with the likes of <a class=hm-link href=#>Billie Eilish</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Joe Jonas</a>, and, crucially, Michelle Keegan herself. The stylist tells HELLO!: "She’s just the nicest person and always has that 'up' energy and makes everyone on set feel great which in turn makes the shoot go well. And of course incredible, natural hair like that is a dream to work on." Luke tells us what Michelle looks for in her hairstyles. "She’s pretty open and knowledgable about what will work for the shoot concept," he says. "As long as it is polished and looks healthy then she’s open to most things and we know she suits up, down, straight or wavy!".&nbsp;</p><p id=esJ68l40_GH data-wc=105>We can say for sure that Michelle's wedding hair was a polished look. Whilst her style was a voluminous ponytail look with a sweeping fringe, the look the actress chose for her own day was a timeless 60s-inspired look with a voluminous bouffant half-up section and loose waves. She had curtain bangs cut into her hair, which we know have come back around as a trend of late, which framed her face. Though Michelle got married nearly a decade ago, we know this look will be one 2024 brides can take tips from as they ponder styles for their big day.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Michelle Keegan's beautiful bridesmaids wore the slinkiest fitted dresses for Mark Wright nuptials" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/73061864de43-mark-wright-michelle-keegan.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Michelle Keegan's beautiful bridesmaids wore the slinkiest fitted dresses for Mark Wright nuptials" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Michelle Keegan's beautiful bridesmaids wore the slinkiest fitted dresses for Mark Wright nuptials</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Michelle Keegan makes subtle change to sheer lace wedding dress" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/7d22de533b84-michelle-keegan-white.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Michelle Keegan makes subtle change to sheer lace wedding dress" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Michelle Keegan makes subtle change to sheer lace wedding dress</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=efZf-pjbGC data-wc=11><strong>Take a look at Luke's expert tips for recreating Michelle's look…</strong></p><p id=eEgkBOJ2mBv data-wc=154>Luke tells us a look like Michelle's that takes inspiration from a past era will always look good if executed well so take your time. "It has a feel of being a nod to the 60s but keeps a modern edge and when done well it looks timeless," he reminds us. "Anything that is done well and beautiful has longevity if it suits the make-up, dress, and occasion". Luke says it is all in the products when it comes to the prep and the products. A mousse is always in his kit for looks that need to last. The foamy product will coat the hair and ensure it holds the style for longer which is ideal if you have naturally fine or straight hair that tends to drop. Mousse also acts as a heat protectant so will ensure your style looks shiny and "healthy" as the former star did on her special day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4e4d1c2c7e1a-michelle-keegan-wedding-cover-a.jpg><p id=emQmPLjzR6R data-wc=108>The expert stylist also says that a salt spray is a must for this look and Keune is his go-to brand. Salt spray adds instant volume and texture which we can see is key with the star's bridal hair. Luke adds that you must allow the curls to cool before playing with them too much to ensure they don't drop and always reaches for the Keune 'Instant Blowout' spray that offers both shine and hold. He tells us: "Balance is key so think about the size and keep it looking shiny and polished and expensive, don’t overload it with product or matte it down too much."&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=es088gN90FQ data-wc=58>Beyond that, Luke says it is all about "keeping the shape full but balanced, the waves looking healthy, and that Bardot inspired height and fringe to still be modern and in keeping with everything else." Just don't touch your hair too much once the look is complete, Luke says, and your style will last long into the night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/73061864de43-mark-wright-michelle-keegan.jpg><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Luke Benson's step-by-step guide for styling your bridal hair like Michelle's</h3><li dir=ltr>Prep damp hair with <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored nofollow">Keune 'Strong Mousse'</a></span>, £18.90, at the roots and <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored nofollow">Keune 'Salt Mist'</a></span>, £26.23, and <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored nofollow">'Instant Blowout'</a></span>, £20.90, spray on the mid-lengths and ends.</li><li dir=ltr>Blowdry the hair with body using a round brush or wrap dry with a paddle brush so the hair has body and is smooth.</li><li dir=ltr>Tong the hair section by section.&nbsp;</li><li dir=ltr>Leave to cool and brush through using a dressing brush to dress out the waves.</li><li dir=ltr>Lightly Backcomb the crown area to give the Bardot feel and height at the crown.</li><li dir=ltr>Bend the fringe away from the face towards the waves and finish with Keune <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored nofollow">'Freestyle Hairspray'</a></span>, £18.15, over the whole look and a misting of <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored nofollow">'Keune Gloss Spray'</a></span>, £20.99, for added shine.</li><p id=eHZXQKNaYE data-wc=12><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Michelle Keegan's Hollywood glow-up: From Coronation Street to polished new look&nbsp;</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
