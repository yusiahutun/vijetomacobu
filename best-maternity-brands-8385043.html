However, most women find that as soon as they start showing, they can no longer fit into their pre-pregnancy wardrobe. “A good rule of thumb for a first pregnancy is to expect to start wearing maternity clothes in your second trimester. If you’re more petite, you may find you need them sooner,” explains <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Maggie Gillette</a>, fashion expert and designer. She also suggests purchasing your maternity clothes a little ahead of time, “so you already have them ready when you need them.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But here’s the deal: Shopping for maternity clothes can be overwhelming for a few reasons. The first is that a lot of your go-to stores and brands don’t offer maternity clothing, which parlays into the second: There are a lot of options when it comes to maternity brands.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We consulted with a handful of stylist moms, who offered the lowdown on the best maternity brands of 2024 for every type of budget. The $-$$ range includes brands with a price point of under-$100 for most items and $$-$$$, around $150. If you are looking to splurge, shop the $$$$ brands, where prices get into the $300s. Keep in mind that even the most expensive maternity brands go on sale, so it’s worth checking out those that might seem out of your price range.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Also, if you are shopping for specific items, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>maternity bras</a>, jeans, or more formal attire, some brands are better than others, so we made sure to break down what each one is best for.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-nothing-fits-but></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nothing Fits But</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nothing Fits But KIKO DRESS" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/mGY-wUQa7LuC_pXpjI9CZQX5AMw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Nothing-Fits-But-KIKO-DRESS-adcb45e0167b4dc09679e37969a37b36.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nothing Fits But</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Lauren Rae Levy Vigneron</a>, a Los Angeles-based stylist, consultant and founder of the LRL Group, discovered this under-the-radar maternity brand while she was pregnant. “Offering breathable fabrics with stylishly loose, feminine fits that are snug only in the right places, these pieces will keep you feeling chic throughout your pregnancy, as well as after,” she says. Their color palettes and prints are both soft and whimsical, much like the details of the garments. “I also like that their website allows you to shop by fabric,” she adds.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Her favorite piece from the brand?

Their website offers something for literally any occasion you could encounter throughout pregnancy to the delivery room and even nursing. “They have extremely reasonable and affordable pricing on all items, which makes shopping here guilt-free, be it something you wear only a few times or for a photo shoot,” she adds. “I am a huge fan of this brand and all they offer to the maternity world.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shipping Policy</strong>: Free standard shipping | <strong>Best for</strong>: Affordable Separates, Dresses, Denim, Swimwear, Nursing Clothes, Petite, Tall and Plus-Sizes | <strong>Size Range</strong>: S-3XL<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sexy-mama-maternity></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sexy Mama Maternity</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sexy Mama Maternity Light Wash Maternity Jeans " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/S1glYZ46JOchJH5GUCzcKVg4sV0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sexy-Mama-Maternity-d8f18318ec13473eac5706fb13f512e6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sexy Mama Maternity</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sexy Mama Maternity is the brand to hit up if you are looking for affordable dresses and gowns that are “comfortable yet still elegant,” Vigneron maintains. “They offer maternity dresses in almost every color, a variety of fabrics and lengths, and flattering fits that hug your bump,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They have great dresses for any occasion, even stunning maternity wedding gowns, and influencer-approved bump-huggers for your maternity photo shoot.

She loves that they have an entire section on their site dedicated to maternity work wear, “and these styles and colors ooze feminine sophistication.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only drawback of ordering from the chic line is shipping.

She also appreciated how the overall style and color options felt “fun” and were easy to style. “It's worth getting a head to toe look with a few mix and match items so you can get creative and make the most out of your pieces,” she says. Old Navy also offers a great maternity denim collection, pajamas and loungewear, nursing bras, swimwear and clothing and work dresses. The website also makes shopping easy, with a “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">shop by trimester</a>” section.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shipping Policy</strong>: Free shipping on $50+ | <strong>Best for</strong>: Activewear, Jeans, Nursing Bras, Loungewear, Swim | <strong>Size Range</strong>: XS-XXL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-hatch></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hatch The Softest Rib Nursing Tank Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1mHmkhJ_9VefgVmX-d5GxckaVH8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hatch-the-softest-rib-nursing-tank-dress-43baa7a2bb934e8ea551b05cd0df35e5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hatch</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you are looking to splurge on stylish maternity wear, Hatch should be your first stop, says Vigneron. “From pregnancy through nursing, Hatch has you covered for every possible need.” “The styles they created are quite representative of styles you would be wearing, pregnant or not,” but given the luxury treatment. Think, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">perfectly crisp white button-down</a>, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">soft cotton jumpsuit</a> or a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">slouchy sweater dress</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But, you get what you pay for. “Clearly, their creative team is full of maternity experts that live for fashionista moments. Their clothing is not only stylish but made from only the best quality of fabrics,” she adds. “I highly recommend checking out their collection, and if you are on a budget, splurge for their items that you can wear during maternity as well as later when you are nursing, and you can justify the investment.” She also suggests their compression socks, “as they were my third trimester best friend.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shipping Policy</strong>: $6 and up | <strong>Best for</strong>: Luxury, Denim, Swim, Activewear, Nursing Bras, Dresses | <strong>Size Range</strong>: XS-XL<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-storq></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Storq Pumping &amp;amp; Nursing Bra Top" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_X4JmXuUASxuGtu-cCWAKltlUoE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Storq-40463afc52e044319ea363e7c26d455b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Storq</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Vigneron shops at Storq for the “coziest essentials.” “If you are looking for chic pieces that are easy to wear, dress up or down, and are made of the softest materials, this brand is for you,” she says.

Everyone’s budget and lifestyle are different, so how much you want to spend on maternity clothes will vary, explains Gillette. In general, she suggests investing the most in pieces that can do double duty. “A black skirt can work for the office with a blouse and with a cute t-shirt for brunch with friends,” she explains. For pregnancy, comfort is key, so she recommends spending a little more to have items that you feel great in. “Generally, think of the items you’re going to wear every day, like jeans and leggings, and consider the price per wear. For me, these are where you want to splurge.” For items that you might only wear once or twice, like a fancy top or a formal dress, you might want to consider investing less. “That said, with all the body changes that happen during pregnancy, it is worth it to purchase some clothes that make you feel good.” A retailer like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">A Pea in the Pod</a> has the full range of prices and styles to choose from.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>When do you start wearing maternity clothes?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Everyone’s body changes differently throughout their journey of pregnancy so when you start wearing maternity clothes is truly a personal preference, explains Vigneron. “While pregnant, I was so excited to style my bump and embrace the process that I started purchasing maternity clothes already for the end of my first trimester,” she said. Others can make it through their second trimester without having to purchase maternity clothes.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you find your size in maternity clothes?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most maternity brand sizing correlates with your usual sizing, says Gillette. If you are a size 6 pre-pregnancy, you will probably be a 6 during. Some brands also offer clothing that is categorized by trimester, adds Vigneron, “and most brands offer charts showing how their brand fits and how any particular style may run size-wise so you know whether to size up or down if needed.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop with Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Leah Groth is a commerce writer and mother-of-two, who tested out lots of maternity brands while pregnant with her two children.
