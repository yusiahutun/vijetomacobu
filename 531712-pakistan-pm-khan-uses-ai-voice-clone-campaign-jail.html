"Today, my determination for real freedom is very strong."</p><p class=align-left>The audio was broadcast at the end of a five-hour live-stream of speeches by PTI supporters on Facebook, X and YouTube, and was overlaid with historic footage of Khan and still images.</p><p class=align-left>It was bookended with genuine video clips from the onetime cricket star's former speeches according to PTI, but a caption appeared at intervals flagging it as the "AI voice of Imran Khan based on his notes".</p><p class=align-left>"This was a no-brainer for us, when Imran Khan is no longer there to actually meet at a political rally," said US-based PTI social media chief Jibran Ilyas.
