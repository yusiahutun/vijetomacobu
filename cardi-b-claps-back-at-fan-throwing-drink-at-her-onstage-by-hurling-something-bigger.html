This trend of throwing things at them is wrong,” wrote another.</p><p>“She did what needed to be done! people need to stop throwing stuff at performers!” claimed another.</p><p>“Maybe now these people will stop throwing things at artists,” wrote another.</p><p>Another said: “She was attacked first. Self-defense hands down!! Would you let someone throw a drink in your face?! H*** no!! Neither did Cardi B.”</p><p>However, others didn’t agree with the way the singer retaliated as one commented: “Violence is not always the answer to retaliation.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Concert-goers throwing items on stage has become a huge problem</h2><p>It seems like many celebs are having things thrown on them on stage as of late, some more light-hearted than others.</p><p>Not too long ago, Bebe Rexa had a phone thrown at her on stage, as <a href=#>Adele issued a warning</a> to her concert-goers, as she said fans had forgotten “show etiquette.”</p><p>Drake, on the other hand, has been having a more light-hearted experience on his It’s All A Blur tour. Recently, he had a 36 G-sized bra thrown at him while performing.</p><p>He then asked concert-goers to “find this woman” which of course they did, and she has now been approached by Playboy to apply for a modeling role.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlvX2h9cK%2FAq5uiZZJisK2tz6xkm5mToHqiwIyfmKdlpJ2%2FsMPIp55mnKKeu6x5wK1koZ2iYryvv9Oanp5lkq56qcHRpaCnn12ovK6x06Ggp59dl7aos8SrZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
