Later, those colours are more muted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/09/30/fb719b80-aa32-4a26-b3f3-60ef64ecdbfa_9c32ba91.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The cemetery was approved in 1891, according to Singapore’s National Library Board. Three brothel keepers had sought to establish the burial ground for impoverished prostitutes, known as karayuki-san, who had been trafficked from rural Japan and made up most of the Japanese population in Singapore at the time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The graves of these prostitutes – which account for more than half of those in the park – can be found in the centre. A plaque explains that many died of illness in poverty and initially their graves had only wooden markers, which eventually rotted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Mutual Self-Help Society – a group that maintained the graveyard in its early years and was established by one of the brothel owners, Futaki Takajiro (who is also buried here) – replaced these with stone markers, which lack names but bear the inscription “Seirei Bodai” (“spiritual enlightenment”), intended as a prayer for the souls of the dead.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">It is the only place where we can learn about the 130 years’ history of Japanese people striving in SingaporeMai Ryoto, of the Japanese Association Singapore’s First Heritage Committee</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the most well-known memorials, standing at the southeast end of the park, is that dedicated to Japanese literary scholar Futabatei Shimei. He wrote the first modern Japanese novel, as noted by the memorial plaque next to the rugged stele marked “Monument of Futabatei Shimei”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shimei, who was also a special correspondent for the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun, died from tuberculosis while travelling back to Japan on May 10, 1909. His body was cremated in Singapore and the ashes were returned to Japan for burial.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To the left of the park’s entrance lies one of the first Japanese known to have died in Singapore, in a white charnel house embossed with a symbol resembling the helm on a ship.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yamamoto Otokichi was a sailor on the ship Hojun-Maru. Having survived a terrible storm at sea, he travelled the world and eventually became a trader. He moved to Singapore in 1862, becoming its first Japanese resident, according to the park’s information board.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/09/30/7b927a3b-3a82-437e-9cb4-7aed36067ae1_e17d1928.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When he died, Otokichi was buried at the Choa Chu Kang Christian Cemetery before his body was cremated and transferred to the Japanese Cemetery Park. A portion of his ashes were returned to Japan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Near Otokichi’s final resting place is a Japanese-inspired prayer hall, which remains mostly closed to the public, although you can peek through the gridded doors at a simple altar adorned with pottery and other items.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After World War I, the karayuki-san became an embarrassment for Japan and many were repatriated as the country’s international profile grew.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/09/30/ebeaaaea-5e83-46bf-9f2f-dd42db146167_7f5658d6.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With industrialisation, the Japanese diaspora became more wealthy and their graves more elaborate, some bound by miniature walls, others flanked by Corinthian-style columns.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, the Japanese were no longer welcome in Singapore after World War II, and their population thinned out.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“After the Japanese defeated the British in the Battle of Singapore [1942], the local population experienced more than three years of oppressive rule,” explains Aédán Mordecai, an analyst at consultancy Sibylline who studied at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. “Necessities were in short supply, while everyday life was under strict control.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/09/30/40d44458-0d0d-4bbb-bf1c-4c5c4fba5e1e_e958f015.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Memorials for Japanese individuals who died during the conflict can be seen in the southwest corner of the park and are kept discreet.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pretty social media pictures are one thing, but the park also has an educational role to play, says Mai Ryoto, of the Japanese Association Singapore’s First Heritage Committee.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is the only place where we can learn about the 130 years’ history of Japanese people striving in Singapore.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is a place teaching us the need to build better friendships between two countries in the future.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/09/30/5d41b2ed-b623-41fa-bdb0-1354d8836234_7d593d23.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Numbers attending the cemetery are far lower now than they were before the Covid-19 pandemic, as Japanese tourism arrivals remain depressed. It could take more than pink bougainvilleas to get camera-phone-wielding visitors back to the park.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZMGzrdWeo2aklZ7Atr7EaJirrJmYuaZ7kmpwbWtkZny0wNSnpaKml2LAqrrGmqeoqpVitq%2B%2F05qeq5mdYsCxu9NmmqGdoqfGbq7LqKqsp51irrOvx7CYsqs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
