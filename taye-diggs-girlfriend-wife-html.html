The two of them were married for a decade before filing for divorce in 2014.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Since then, Menzel has moved on and is married to actor Aaron Lohr, her co-star in the film version of&nbsp;Rent. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Diggs, though, is currently single. In an interview with&nbsp;Access Daily,&nbsp;Diggs was asked why he isn't dating anyone now. He said: <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>&nbsp;I'll be honest, there are times when I feel lonely just because there is so much going on and it would be great to have someone to discuss stuff with outside of my son. But when I think about that whole romantic dynamic, it's just too much.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Diggs also spoke about the unique relationship he has with his son.
