However, Deschanel was sitting nearby and as a result found herself getting abducted by two blue aliens, who had been tasked with kidnapping Perry but accidentally took Deschanel due to their similar appearance.</p><p>After Deschanel is beamed up, the "New Girl" actress made a deal with the aliens and agreed to pretend to be Perry in order to save Earth. Deschanel then underwent a Perry-style makeover, complete with some of the singer's infamous looks, including her "California Girls" blue wig and whipped cream shooting bikini.</p><p>The video then concluded with Deschanel, who had saved Earth, performing as Perry for the alien planet.</p><p>Watch the video, below!</p><p>Later on Monday, Perry and Deschanel went live on Perry's Instagram to chat about the video.</p><p>Since Perry was on maternity leave when the music video was to be shot, she recommended Deschanel to star in it.</p><p>"I had just had Daisy," she recalled to Deschanel, 40. "I called you up and I had this idea that Zooey would step in while I was taking a little bit of a leave."</p><p>"I was like what a great chance because for so long we have had this funny relationship -- friendship -- but obviously people think we look alike," she added, to which Deschanel agreed, saying she takes being mistaken for Perry as a "compliment."</p><p>Also, during the chat, Perry revealed that when she first moved out to Los Angeles she told people she was Deschanel in order to get into clubs.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"When I moved to LA maybe 18 years ago...I was pretty much a nobody and you were just getting huge at that time like Zooey Deschanel ran the world at that particular moment," Perry recalled. "In that moment, I was so complimented to look like you."</p><p>She continued, "I have to admit something to you on a Live that when I first got to LA I went to the club a lot and wanted to get into the club and I had no money and I had no clout. I had nothing and sometimes I would pose as you to get into the club."</p><p>However, this wasn't news to Deschanel, who said she was such a "goody-two-shoes" at the time that when people said they saw her at the club, she knew something was up.</p><p>"Everyone kept telling me about this Katy...I was like, 'Who is this Katy?'" Deschanel shared. "And then when I met you I was so relieved because you are so pretty. I was like 'Oh, thank God. She's so pretty!"</p><a id=gallery-link-c729ce41-dd84-4258-80e7-04cbf68b4658 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:c729ce41-dd84-4258-80e7-04cbf68b4658 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:0c9fa3eb-47f2-4106-9c4f-f865e6ce10d6 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/96/4by3/2020/12/21/966cbef0a8dc46ebb0cdbe619fd08253_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Intagram</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3F7kGtma2lfoK61xYypnKuqqWLHsLvEsmSdnaOYtaK6xKVkpaefoK6ttcqeZKenpGLBqbGMnqWdZZ%2BberW0xGauqKqcmXquwdKimmaumZmysHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
