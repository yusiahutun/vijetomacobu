It follows Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as they discover a young Anakin Skywalker on the desert planet of Tatooine. Alongside the Jedi were characters like Padmé Amidala, a young queen and future mother of Luke and Leia Skywalker, and the crafty Jar Jar Binks, whose clumsy antics sparked plenty of controversy among fans.</p><p>As the years passed, many of the cast members continued to find success in Hollywood and beyond. From Liam Neeson’s action-packed roles to Ewan McGregor’s genre-hopping performances, plenty of actors from The Phantom Menace are still making their mark in the entertainment industry today.
