Power, authenticity, inclusivity: These are words Lyons tells me "get tossed around in an embarrassing way" in fashion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Not that fashion brands shouldn't try to reflect the women who shop with them. They just need to do it in a real way. "Representation and people seeing themselves, that shit is meaningful and makes a huge difference," Lyons says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In Lyons' view, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a38485544/mejuri-went-from-your-instagram-feed-to-well-everywhere/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="jewelry label Mejuri" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">jewelry label Mejuri</a> is as close as fashion gets to meaning what it says. It's in part because of Mejuri's casting for its International Women's Day campaign: Lyons, who also designed a capsule for the brand, appears alongside actress Tommy Dorfman, Olympian Allyson Felix, and journalist Noor Tagouri.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The identities and experiences in this group proved Mejuri's sincerity to Lyons: "I’m not a spring chicken... and I think that says a lot in terms of the way that they’re showing up," she tells BAZAAR.com.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Before the Mejuri <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://mejuri.com/info/international-womens-day data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="capsule collection" data-vars-ga-product-id=58db073d-8d6d-4afe-a583-7103abdd5e4b data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://mejuri.com/info/international-womens-day data-product-url=https://mejuri.com/info/international-womens-day data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://mejuri.pxf.io/c/3006986/890344/12305?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmejuri.com%2Finfo%2Finternational-womens-day&subId1=har&subid3=xid:{xid}" data-affiliate-network='{"id":"642b02c5-851e-4175-b5cf-f4b8355af355","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{"trackonomics":{"merchant_id":"60049","merchant_name":"Mejuri","network_name":"IR","network_id":"3","product_id":"459","product_name":"Harper&#39;s BAZAAR US","product_external_id":"459","product_url":null}},"network":{"id":"a332915a-6423-480f-9153-e3973f438607","name":"Trackonomics","metadata":{}},"product_metadata":{"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5":{"link":"https://mejuri.pxf.io/c/3006986/890344/12305?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmejuri.com%2Finfo%2Finternational-womens-day&subId1={subid}","network_name":"ir","appended_link":"https://mejuri.pxf.io/c/3006986/890344/12305?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmejuri.com%2Finfo%2Finternational-womens-day&subId1={subid}&subid3=xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2023-06-14 20:54:15.954667"}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$2,022.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=48f21769-d3e2-4d89-baee-2b50fe2d352a class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">capsule collection</a> and campaign launched online, Lyons discussed her lifelong relationship with jewelry, the shifts in fashion she thinks are here to stay, and the biggest career lessons she's learned lately with BAZAAR.com. And yes, she seemed authentic—in the real way.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><br>Of all the projects you could take on next, what made you interested in a jewelry capsule—and with Mejuri, specifically?<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I remember when I first heard the name of the brand. I have two goddaughters who are in their early 20s and they were going on about the fact that a Mejuri store had opened up around the corner from us. I was like, alright, let’s go. And there was a line! I thought it was really interesting. It was the first time I’d really seen a brand focus on fine jewelry in this way where it was very thoughtful and very systematic. They were thinking about, how can I merchandise and speak to the customer in a way that’s explaining to them very clearly what the offering is and why it’s the price that it is? It felt different to me than what I’d seen prior. At J.Crew we did a little fine jewelry, but we didn’t have the breadth of offering.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So I paid attention to the brand and what they were doing. I started seeing it everywhere or it came up when I asked people what they were wearing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then, ironically, they reached out to me. And I was like, of course. I would do anything. I’m a fan of the brand, but to be my age and being active as a model, I was like, great! The whole team was really, very clear about what they wanted to accomplish. They were intentional about supporting all women, and it felt like a breath of fresh air.</p><img alt="jenna lyons stands in front of a backdrop wearing a suit and mejuri jewelry to illustrate her new mejuri campaign" title="Mejuri Designed by Jenna Lyons 2022" width=2001 height=3002 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/mejuri-iwd-jenna-210-v4a-qc-1645195916.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">Two out of three pieces you designed are signet rings. What drew you to that specific type of jewelry?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A couple things. My father is British and everyone in my family on his side of the family has always had signet rings. And I realized it was very rare that women had them. It was always the men.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you go back in time, they were used often as a signature by the clergy and people of faith. The most powerful people in the community were often the clergymen and they used signets as a seal on their letters. They’ve got this rich and dramatic and pompous history, but at the same time can be worn in a totally different way.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I stack them, because I like that idea that you can collect them. I also wear other peoples' or give them to other people.</p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Shop Jenna Lyons for Mejuri<span aria-hidden=true

How do you typically style your jewelry?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s an interesting question because I realized at some point in my trajectory, I started to get photographed more frequently. I had grown up with this idea of constantly changing and wearing costume jewelry for the look. Not that I don’t still do that. But because I was photographed more frequently, I found that I was feeling more confident when I anchored myself in something. So that became my glasses, I always wore the same pair of glasses all the time. I started to wear my hair back all the time. I wore these things that became consistent and it made me more comfortable.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I found that that also happened in my jewelry. I used to wear a ton of jewelry and I also dated someone in the jewelry industry so I was constantly being gifted tons of jewelry. Now, I’ve really gotten down to a few key pieces. I wear a watch that never tells the time but I love the history of the watch. I wear a signet ring that I had made for me, and I’ve been wearing it for years. But I never wear it on the same finger.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">How has your relationship to getting dressed changed over the last two years?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The first thing that’s changed is that it starts from the waist up. But there’s been a lot of things. I found that in the beginning of the pandemic I was like, oh cool, sweatpants, no makeup, super casual, maybe the camera is on, maybe the camera is off. But as it’s gone on, I’ve found that investing in getting dressed and putting on makeup and putting on a nice something and other, it feels better for myself and more respectful to the person I’m meeting. I’ve been on some calls where people are like, “I dressed up for you!” And that’s so nice.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I do think there’s something generous about that. There’s so little ceremony left, you know? We don’t have any of that. So that’s been a shift in my thinking from two years ago to now.</p><img alt="jenna lyons models with tommy dorfman in a mejuri campaign 2022" title="Mejuri Designed by Jenna Lyons 2022" width=2001 height=2417 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/mejuri-iwd-jenna-tommy-444-v5-qc-1645196020.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Mejuri</span></p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">I'm a shopping editor, so I have to ask: What's the last thing you bought?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s so funny, I don’t shop that much anymore.

The quality of the materials are great. It’s one of those things that I feel is not as obvious of a purchase but it’s important.

What are your predictions for the future of the category?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The whole industry, whether it's jewelry and/or fashion, the relationship to the consumer and the desire for information and transparency on all fronts is a deep shift. I can’t imagine it ever going back.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I have a fifteen-year-old son and it’s really interesting to see and hear how he shops. He will not shop without reading a review, without comparing. He wants to trust the product and know the people behind it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Very similarly, it’s an incredible shift in the dialogue.

What's the biggest lesson you've learned for finding or trying a new career path?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One of the best lessons I’ve learned is people are often just scared of change. And for whatever reason I was always really excited about change and ready to try something new. Sometimes I’m scared, or I try things and it doesn’t really work out so well, but having that experience of trying a lot of different things and having the world not fall apart has allowed me the confidence and openness to try other things and not have expectations going in.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I’m also realizing that the core tenets of doing something well are the same across the board.
