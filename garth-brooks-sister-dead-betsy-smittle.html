"So happy she got to meet my beautiful daughter! We love you and miss you already Aunt Betsy!"</p><p>"She has a wonderful knack for rhythm, but probably her greatest talent is relating to the audience," Brooks told <a href=#>Oklahoma Today</a> in 1993, adding that he called Smittle "Hollywood." She was one of the singer's four older half-siblings. He also has an older brother named Kelly.</p><p>Smittle released her solo album,&nbsp;'Rough Around the Edges,' in 1994.
