Rather than providing a fully immersive experience that you’ll find with VR headsets, Nreal AR glasses prove the potential of real-world mixed reality. (Find out more about <a href=# rel=nofollow>the differences between augmented and virtual reality</a>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Designed to look like a pair of stylish sunglasses, Nreal Airs offer more comfort and discretion compared to classic AR glasses, which are often bulky and some require a full wrap-around band to secure on your head.</p><p>Nreal Air glasses claim to be an “unparalleled gaming companion” and are compatible with some USB-C devices including Android, Macs, and the Steam Deck. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">official Nreal website</a> has a compatibility list, so you can check whether your current devices will connect to these AR glasses</p><p>For now, let’s take a look at the Nreal Air glasses and your Steam Deck.</p><h2 id=how-to-use-nreal-air-glasses-with-your-steam-deck>How to Use Nreal Air Glasses With Your Steam Deck</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/connect-nreal-air-glasses-to-steam-deck.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Connecting your Nreal Air glasses to your Steam Deck couldn’t be easier. There are no apps or software to download and install—simply connect the angled end of the provided USB-C cable to the Nreal Airs and the other end to your Steam Deck. Your Steam Deck will automatically recognize your AR glasses as another monitor and adjust the resolution accordingly.</p><h2 id=how-nreal-air-glasses-can-improve-your-steam-deck-experience>How Nreal Air Glasses Can Improve Your Steam Deck Experience</h2><p>The Steam Deck is an excellent piece of gaming kit, although it does have some limitations. Some common complaints about the Steam Deck include its heavy weight, which can cause wrist pain and other aches, as well as its restricted screen size and display quality.</p><p>Enter the Nreal Air glasses. From resolving common gripes to upgrading your overall gaming experience (further supporting the argument that <a href=# rel=nofollow>the Steam Deck could replace all your gaming tech</a>), here are five reasons why Nreal Air Glasses are the best accessory for your Steam Deck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nreal-air-glasses-will-upgrade-your-steam-deck-screen>1. Nreal Air Glasses Will Upgrade Your Steam Deck Screen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/steam-deck-games-screenshot.jpg><p>The Steam Deck screen is okay, but at just 1280x800 pixels with an LCD screen, it's at risk of losing the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Nintendo Switch (OLED) vs Valve Steam Deck</a> battle for the best handheld console. Pairing your Steam Deck with Nreal Air glasses, however, will upgrade your screen to an impressive full HD 3840x1080 pixels OLED screen (1920x1080 pixels per-eye resolution).</p><p>With the invisible internal speakers that are built into the glasses’ stems, you’ll gain a fully immersive visual and audio experience with a pair of Nreal Airs connected to your Steam Deck.</p><h2 id=nreal-air-glasses-increase-the-quality-of-your-steam-deck-display>2. Nreal Air Glasses Increase the Quality of Your Steam Deck Display</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/nreal-air-glasses-130-inch-screen.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Forget about large external monitors, you can transform your 7” Steam Deck screen into a 130” full HD display through the Nreal Air glasses. This feature is probably the most compelling, as the difference a large HD display will make to your gaming experience is unparalleled—especially as it's packaged in a compact pair of glasses.</p><p>This immersive cinema experience works best when you’re facing a blank wall without excessively bright lights, although you shouldn’t face any issues in a well-lit room. The Nreal Airs do come with a lens cover plate that will block out some external glare if you want to use the glasses in very bright conditions.</p><h2 id=nreal-air-glasses-help-prevent-common-gaming-aches-and-pains>3. Nreal Air Glasses Help Prevent Common Gaming Aches and Pains</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/steam-deck-weight-causes-wrist-pain.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A significant reason why the Nreal Airs are an <a href=# rel=nofollow>essential Steam Deck accessory you’ll want to consider buying</a> is that you’ll save yourself from common gaming aches and pains.</p><p>Weighing in at over one and a half pounds, the Steam Deck can cause some serious wrist pain when used for a prolonged period of time. Rather than spending hours straining your wrists (or even hunched over with your arms leaning on a table to take the weight), connecting the Nreal Air glasses will allow you to extend your Steam Deck gameplay without pain. You can relax your posture, and have your hands and Steam Deck resting in your lap, to avoid those common gaming aches and pains.</p><p>Furthermore, Nreal Airs are also lightweight and adjustable to fit your face for ultimate comfort. Three different-sized nose pads are supplied to find the right fit for you, so you won’t feel awkward wearing the glasses while you game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nreal-air-glasses-are-compatible-with-prescription-lenses>4. Nreal Air Glasses Are Compatible With Prescription Lenses</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/nreal-air-glasses-lens-close-up.jpg><p>The Nreal Airs are compatible with prescription lenses, which is great news for anyone who needs to wear glasses to support their eyesight or eye health. Prescription insert frames are provided with the Nreal Air AR glasses so that you can request a customized prescription lens at your local opticians.</p><p>Alternatively, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lensology</a> is touted as the go-to online store to buy Nreal Air Prescription Inserts and offers worldwide shipping.</p><h2 id=nreal-air-glasses-provide-a-portable-130-prime-screen>5. Nreal Air Glasses Provide a Portable 130″ Screen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/play-steam-deck-on-your-travels.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the Steam Deck is a portable device, you want to make sure any accessories are equally compact and lightweight. The Nreal Air glasses not only tick these boxes but they are also low maintenance. There isn’t an internal battery to worry about charging—the power is supplied by your Steam Deck—which also means one less adapter to pack for traveling.</p><p>Because you can also <a href=# rel=nofollow>use the Steam Deck as a desktop computer</a>, pairing the device with Nreal Airs means that digital nomads can work on a 130” screen, or even a triple monitor setup on Mac, without having to pack any bulky display monitors.</p><h2 id=nreal-air-glasses-could-be-the-solution-to-your-steam-deck-problems>Nreal Air Glasses Could Be the Solution to Your Steam Deck Problems</h2><p>While the Nreal Air glasses are an excellent gaming accessory, it’s worth noting that they hold a similar price tag to the Steam Deck. The benefits of an improved full HD portable display, however, and reduced risk of carpal tunnel syndrome help justify the cost.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wider compatibility for the Nreal Air glasses is also being rolled out. At the time of writing, Macs that are equipped with M-series chips with macOS 12.0 and above and some Android phones are compatible with Nreal Airs. You can also connect your Nintendo Switch, although you’ll need to buy a special adaptor for this to work.</p><p>If you’re looking for a solution to the Steam Deck’s common complaints, or if you simply want a portable screen that you can game and work on, then Nreal Airs is the best Steam Deck accessory for you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGilq52RoXqitdFmnqWZo6iytHnAq5xmrJiaeqOx0q1kmpuTmsC0u9GyZJ%2BnomLAtbHApmSdnZOgfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
