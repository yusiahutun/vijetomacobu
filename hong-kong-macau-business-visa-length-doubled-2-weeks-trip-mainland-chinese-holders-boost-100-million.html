agency’s entry-exit administrative department, Wang Ling, said the change was set to benefit 100 million individually owned firms, as well as staff from 30,000 companies who registered for multiple business visas.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We hope to better meet the needs of longer periods of business activities, help business personnel to explore business opportunities extensively and undergo negotiations in a more in-depth manner,” she told a press conference.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0

Kong visa scheme for Shenzhen residents resurrect parallel trading?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mainlanders will soon be able to submit applications for one-off entry business visas at designated counters of 3,400 institutions managed by public security branches across the country, rather than through local offices where they live.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They can also apply for multiple-entry ones through “smart visa facilities” from May 6 at those sites.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Authorities also announced that a visa scheme for mainland talent that was launched in February last year would be expanded to cover not only residents in the nine Guangdong province cities in the bay area, but also those in Beijing and Shanghai.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As of mid-April, Hong Kong had welcomed more than 18,000 arrivals under the pilot scheme, according to the city government.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Under the scheme, talent in six fields including scientific research, education, healthcare, law and business are able to apply for multi‑entry visas ranging from one to five years in length for stays in Hong Kong and Macau of up to 30 days each time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bay area is Beijing’s plan to integrate Hong Kong, Macau and nine Guangdong cities into an economic powerhouse.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Hong Kong government welcomed the measures, saying they would facilitate the city’s further integration into national development and achieve concrete results in improving the “southbound and northbound” flow of talent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[We] will continue to maintain close liaison with the mainland authorities, with a view to further promoting the connection and exchanges of talents between the mainland and Hong Kong, and creating stronger impetus of growth for Hong Kong and the entire [bay area],” a government spokesman said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=#

had advocated the ideas at the nation’s annual political meetings in March.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said he was glad Beijing had recognised the mutual benefits of making it easier for mainland businesspeople and professionals with high spending power to stay longer in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For example, if they come for a trade fair which usually takes days, they can soon make full use of the two-week period to meet more clients and even join plenty of mega events,” said Lam, the honorary chairman of the Hong Kong Cross-Border E-commerce Association.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This could tremendously benefit the local hospitality and service industry.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Barrister Alex Fan Hoi-kit said making it easier for Beijing and Shanghai legal professionals to get to the city could strengthen Hong Kong’s development in arbitration in the long run.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Many state-owned and sizeable companies situated in Beijing and Shanghai have extensive connections with Hong Kong and international markets,” said Fan, who is experienced in commercial arbitration and mediation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Allowing their legal representatives to come to Hong Kong easier can greatly encourage the mainland enterprises to use legal services here.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lawmaker Jesse Shang Hailong said he expected the relaxation would complement the existing Top Talent Pass Scheme to deepen academic exchanges.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span

data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said the change would incentivise scholars from top-notch academic institutions and national laboratories based in Beijing and Shanghai to undertake more extensive research projects and offer longer courses in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other measures announced by the National Immigration Administration covered Macau. The threshold for mainland residents to apply for multiple visas related to trade fairs and performance will be lowered. Doctors and members of tour groups to Hengqin island, a development zone neighbouring Macau, will also benefit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Macau Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng said the city was “geared up” to receive more mainland tours and welcome high-quality talent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Guangdong public security authorities also announced measures related to Hong Kong’s cross-boundary private cars. Starting from May 1, applicants will no longer be subject to investment tax status vetting when they apply for different types of “dual plates”. Certain types of car owners will not need to extend their licences every five years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZomKusmZi5pnuSa21pbmZrfKm7zaBkpKeenHqurcKarGaapai2r7HSrGSvoaOWeq2xzaCroWWUpMKjuMSdZGtlp5qyrL%2BMramiqF2irqq6y5qlnWWTnbavsdKeZKGnnJmys7%2BMm6aoq6RifnF8jKagpaSZpLs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
