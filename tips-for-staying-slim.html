So master the art of the satisfying, low-cal caffeine boost. Joos's order: Vanilla almond milk latte. Dannijo girls: One third coffee with steamed soy milk, no foam. "We're like the Bobbsey twins at Starbucks," says Danielle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Get into breakfast.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I've learned that eating breakfast everyday and taking my time is very productive," says Joos, who makes a parfait</p><img alt="this image is not available" title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">of lactose-free cottage cheese with berries and bananas ("they keep me full"), along with a drizzle of maple syrup. (Because of digestive issues, Joos avoids refined sugar, dairy, and most wheat.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As for the sisters, they're big into breakfasts, like egg whites, avocado toast, and a half of a grapefruit. Or in the summer, there's Jodie's famous smoothie: Strawberry, banana, blueberry, soy milk, yogurt and a pinch of ice. Avocado, coconut water, and frozen banana is another favorite. "The bananas always have to be frozen," says Danielle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Eat often, and in small portions.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">All three girls swear that they eat every few hours, and pretty much whatever they're craving. They just never eat giant heaping Applebee's-size portions.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Become a modified sandwich artist.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Joos doesn't eat bread, so she's gotten creative with rice cake stackers. A regular lunch might be rice cakes topped with goat cheese, tomato and black pepper, or turkey, cucumber and mustard. Her healthy-person PB&J is a rice cake smeared with almond butter and topped with sliced bananas.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Don't fear carbs</strong>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jodie is an avid cook, and she loves dinner. She just makes sure to use healthy, whole ingredients where she can. Think homemade pasta for bolognese, or steamed fish and veggies, or grilled shrimp tacos with whole wheat tortillas.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Don't give up your sins.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Snyder's aren't heavy drinkers, but they'll still have a cocktail when they're out. Danielle likes Johnny Walker Black and soda, a drink she picked up from her days living in Nashville; Jodie prefers a glass of Sancerre. Joos still smokes a <span>very, very occasional</span>cigarette now and again, and loves a glass of Pinot Noir.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Rethink snacking.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Carrot sticks and Greek yogurt aren't your only options. "Oatmeal is the secret to everything," says Danielle. For breakfast or an afternoon snack, she'll have a McCains individual packet, or Quaker Low Sugar Instant Oatmeal in the Maple Brown Sugar flavor, which only has 120 calories. "It's hearty and healthy and leaves you full and satiated," she says. Other options: Pita chips with hummus, Special K Blueberry Cereal Bars, trail mix, apples, and oranges.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Be careful when eating out.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Dannijo girls go out for work. A lot. The thing is, they don't tend to eat too much while they're doing it. "The idea is that we're there to work, not to eat, and people aren't usually watching what we're eating," says Jodie. They'll have a few bites, then eat together after the event. Sushi, or chicken and fish at home. (And yes they eat regular sushi, not just sashimi. "I don't like raw fish without rice," says Jodie.) Joos eats out by process of elimination. "Any dish the contains bad ingredients is out, until one is left with the least number of offenders," she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>No foods are off limits.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Joos like potato chips and French fries with mayo. "I don't like to deprive myself of anything that makes me feel good," she says. And the Dannijo girls love a sweet treat. Jodie can't say no to an Oreo milkshake, Danielle likes birthday cake ice cream in a chocolate covered cone with rainbow sprinkles.
