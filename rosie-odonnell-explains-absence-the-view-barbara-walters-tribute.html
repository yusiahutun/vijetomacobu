"Although 93 man, who wouldn't take that? What a long and eventful, legendary life she had. Spoke to every prominent world leader in memory, interviewed everyone who was anyone, and I was lucky enough to be in her orbit for a good many years and we saw a lot of Broadway shows together. And whenever we'd go backstage, I'd like try to help her, you know, over the steps and she would always smack my hand away and tell me to leave her alone. She knew what she was doing, I can tell you that."</p><p>O'Donnell added, "May she rest in peace, and may everyone remember what barriers she broke down for women, she really did. She was the first, and will always be remembered."</p><p>On Tuesday, the women of "The View" honored Walters in the show's first episode back since the legendary journalist's death.</p><p>Several current panelists -- including <a href=#>Whoopi Goldberg</a>, <a href=#>Joy Behar</a> and <a href=#>Sunny Hostin</a> -- all paid tribute.</p><p>"Tributes are pouting in from around the world to celebrate Barbara Walters and today we're remembering our friend and colleague," Goldberg said at the top of the hour. "And the reason why we're all sitting here, really, if not for her, I don't know where most of us would be."</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#WhoopiGoldberg</a> reflects on meeting Barbara Walters for the first time and shares how they both bonded over motherhood while balancing demanding careers.</p><p>"It was really an audition for 20 years later to come hang out [on <a href=#>#TheView</a>]." <a href=#>https://t.co/cVclFZQmjA</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/No0WAD1ZmD</a></p>— The View (@TheView) <a href=#>January 3, 2023</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@TheView</a><p>"It's true. We knew her better than anyone I think. She very much defied sexism and she defied ageism, she went right into the jaws of the lion," said Behar. "She started 'The View' when she was 68 years old. Very few people start a new career at that age. She was the original role model to everybody else. She was one of a kind and really important to the industry."</p><p>Hostin recalled some of her first interactions with Walters after she joined the show, saying she felt a sense of validation when the latter agreed with Hostin's decision to change her questions to be more in her own voice.</p><p>"She started helping me and I thought, my goodness, the generosity of that moment," she continued, getting a little emotional. "She validated my opinion and after that day she would ask me during the Hot Topics meeting, 'What do you think, Sunny?' I was like, 'Barbara Walters is asking me what I think? Wow.'"</p><p>"There was nobody like her," added Goldberg before a commercial break. "There isn't anyone like her and like all firsts, she's the first and there are many of us duplicates, but there will never be another Barbara Walters."</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@MeredithVieira</a> reflects on her time with Barbara Walters and shares why she calls her job offer to moderate 'The View' a gift.</p><p>"I was lucky to be selected and [<a href=#>#TheView</a>] opened the door to so many opportunities for me." <a href=#>https://t.co/cVclFZQmjA</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/CTJDnNBk9u</a></p>— The View (@TheView) <a href=#>January 3, 2023</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@TheView</a><p>Also during Tuesday's episode, the show's first co-hosts <a href=#>Debbie Matenopoulos</a>, <a href=#>Star Jones</a>, and <a href=#>Meredith Vieira</a> all appeared in person, on Zoom and over the phone, respectively, to emotionally reflect on their relationships with Walters and what they learned from her.</p><p>Meanwhile, other former panelists -- <a href=#>Lisa Ling</a>, <a href=#>Sherri Shepherd</a> and <a href=#>Elisabeth Hasselbeck</a> -- also appeared to honor Walters.</p><p>Appearing over Zoom, Hasselbeck said she "didn't expect waves of grief to come over me like they have with her because I think we all just assumed we'd continue to be able to speak with her, share thoughts with her."</p><p>"She and I had a layered relationship. She was my TV mom, my mentor ... she was contagiously, compassionately curious and I love that about her," she added. "She gave me a chance, she changed my life. The 10 years next to her side and with all of you at different times, enriched my life."</p><p>The show closed out its hour-long tribute to Walters with a highlight reel of Walters' greatest moments.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>"THIS IS MY LEGACY!": See the historic moment Oprah Winfrey and 25 female journalists honored Barbara Walters as she retired from <a href=#>@TheView</a> in May 2014. <a href=#>https://t.co/cVclFZQU98</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jZ825o7Qul</a></p>— The View (@TheView) <a href=#>January 3, 2023</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@TheView</a> <a id=gallery-link-3d69639b-27ab-4ed6-b61e-aa45fef512ad class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:3d69639b-27ab-4ed6-b61e-aa45fef512ad data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:18e6277e-2a96-4822-8a79-8bc600d18caf data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/31/4by3/2023/01/03/31477b377f79439e913cdbf55b7bd429_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2pmaWxfp7y0tcRmpp2nnqOyrbiMnq%2BppJGeu7R5wJuqnqaTmnq1tMRmraKdp2Kvor7BmqmaZaeWubWx0axkraqZl8K1sY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
