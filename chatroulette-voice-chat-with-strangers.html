In truth, it has existed for as long as live video has been available on the web, but the launch of Chatroulette in 2009 helped catapult the practice into a more mainstream audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Chatroulette is not your only option. If you want to have a random video chat online, many services exist. Better yet, they don't come with the same controversial baggage as Chatroulette.</p><h2 id=what-went-wrong-at-chatroulette>What Went Wrong at Chatroulette?</h2><p>Chatroulette was in the headlines for the wrong reasons within months of its launch.</p><p>One study showed that one in eight spins would reveal a naked person, and that 89 percent of users were male. In the days when parental controls were not as robust as they are today, the figures immediately set alarm bells ringing.</p><p>Here's how the president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, <a href=#>Emie Allen</a>, described Chatroulette in March 2013:</p><p>"This is one of the worst faces of the internet that I've seen. It's disconnecting human relationships rather than connecting them. [It's] the last place parents want their kids to be. This is a huge red flag; this is extreme social networking. This is a place kids are going to gravitate to."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=using-chatroulette-to-talk-to-strangers-today>Using Chatroulette to Talk to Strangers Today</h2><p>In response to the early criticism, Chatroulette did clean up its act. The last few years have seen a steady increase in the number of safety measures in place.</p><p>Nudity is officially banned across the entire service. An algorithm filters out around 60 percent of pornographic content. All users need to make an account to use the service. Users can be reported, and if you get more than three complaints in a fixed period of time, you receive a ban.</p><p>But sixty percent doesn't sound like a lot. Considering more than 30 percent of the user base is under 18, there is still cause for concern. Since then, plenty of users have flocked to alternative platforms they can use.</p><h2 id=omegle>1. <a href=#>Omegle</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/omegle.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps the best-known alternative to Chatroulette is Omegle. To try and help you <a href=#>find an interesting stranger to talk to</a>, you can enter some optional interests before you start your conversation.</p><p>Omegle also offers a text-only mode. For people who don't want to reveal themselves in public but are still looking for someone to chat with, it is ideal.</p><p>Unlike Chatroulette, however, Omegle does still have an unmoderated adult section. Its presence is concerning, but it does at least act as a way for people who want to engage in that stuff to keep it out of the main video chat section.</p><h2 id=hiyak>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hiyak</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hiyak.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hiyak is one of the most popular one-on-one video chat apps on both Android and iOS. The free service lets you make random video calls with people from all over the world.</p><p>Features include filters and effects for your video output, robust filters to control your matches (including gender, age, location, and interests), and a zero-tolerance approach to predators, cyberbullying, racism, and spam. There is a swipe feature to help you find stories and people you would like to talk to, everyone can create a profile, and you can send gifts to people that you get on well with.</p><p>Hiyak is available in almost all locations, with 190 countries supported around the world.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Hiyak for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Android</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=buzzcast>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BuzzCast</a></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>BuzzCast (formerly FaceCast) is a bit different from the other services we've discussed so far. This service is only available via the smartphone app; there is no web app you can use. The app is only available on Android.</p><p>The app will pair you with strangers for a conversation. If you get on well with the other person, you can start following them. Once you are following each other, you can dive back into a video chat at any point. The feature makes it slightly easier to use the app to build up meaningful friendships.</p><p>Other features include a GPS, so you can <a href=#>find nearby strangers to talk to</a>, a way to collate your best "Moments" and display them on your profile, and an unlimited number of video streams.</p><p>Some basic video editing tools are available. They include special effects, filters, stickers, music, and more.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> BuzzCast for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Android</a> (Free)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=camsurf>4. <a href=#>CamSurf</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/camsurf.png><p>CamSurf offers both a web app and a smartphone app. The phone app is available on Android and iOS.</p><p>CamSurf's web app lets you dive in and start chatting straight away; you don't need to make an account or enter other details. From an ease-of-use perspective, that's a good thing. However, as we saw with Chatroulette, the practice invariably leads to problems.</p><p>If you use the CamSurf smartphone app, you can filter connections by language and location. Besides that, the web and smartphone versions are near-identical.</p><h2 id=chatspin>5. <a href=#>Chatspin</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chatspin-670x412.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chatspin is a web-only way to video chat with strangers. Like Omegle, there's also a text chat facility available to anyone who does not want to turn on their mic or camera.</p><p>Once again, however, security features are minimal. You only need to enter your gender to find another person to talk to. There is no account creation process to work through.</p><h2 id=meowchat>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">MeowChat</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/meowchat-670x353.png><p>Like FaceCast, MeowChat is only available either the Android smartphone app. The app is available in more than 130 countries around the world.</p><p>The service supports followers and fans. As such, you can see who are the most entertaining people to talk to in your local area, as endorsed by the other users.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Download:</strong> MeowChat for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Android</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=paltalk>7. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paltalk</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/paltalk.png><p>Paltalk has more than 100 million downloads across its apps for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS, thus making it one of the most popular Chatroulette alternatives.</p><p>Some of the best features of the app include group chat rooms (each of which has a specific focus), support for gifts and stickers, and a friend function that lets you cement relationships that you make on the platform. Examples of group chats include music quizzes, politics, and a bunch of geo-focused rooms. What's more, the app is free to use.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tinychat>8. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TinyChat</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/tinychat.jpg><p>TinyChat is a Chatroulette alternative that tries to be a little more serious than some of the other options on this list. While many of these types of services always seem to retain that slightly seedy vibe, TinyChat has positioned itself as being dedicated to community building.</p><p>You can search for nearby people, people who have received "gifts" for being engaging on video, and filter by the interests of the people you want to chat to.</p><h2 id=holla>9. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Holla</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/holla-app.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Often touted as an Omegle alternative, the app boasts of a similar service quality as Omegle and so is a perfect candidate as an Chatroulette web alternative. The app lets you connect with people from all over the world through it's free video chat platform.</p><p>Among its free video and online text features, the app also offers a gender and country filter.</p><p>Another feature on display is its real-time translation, which helps you avoid language barriers. And there's the customization features that allow you to apply cool facial features and homepage display personalization.</p><h2 id=exercise-caution-when-chatting-with-strangers>Exercise Caution When Chatting With Strangers</h2><p>If managed correctly, chatting with strangers online can be a fun way to get to know new people. However, you do need to exercise caution. Make sure no personal information is visible in the background of your video, don't display valuable items, and make sure you are following the rules of the service you are using. And this list just scratches the surface, there are plenty more available.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fmLWiwNGorKWdpKmybsLOopqeZZOdrrV51qKroWWjqb%2Biusaeqaxn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
