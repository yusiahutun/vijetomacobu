On the long&nbsp;list of his acting contribution to&nbsp;the TV industry, Till the Day I Die and What, Will, I, Have, Left are&nbsp;some of the examples of the episodes of The Originals aired in 2018. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Besides The Originals, he is also well known for TV series such as Heartland, Endgame, and Reign.

Miss California, before she was Miss USA 2011. The good thing for the icy blue-eyed&nbsp;actor was he caught Alyssa's attention from his&nbsp;show The Tudors,&nbsp;and she became her fan way before the duo hooked up. Alyssa calls Torrance&nbsp;"T"&nbsp;for short. &nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>The Bachelorette Canada:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="Kevin Wendt Engaged, Girlfriend, Family, Net Worth" rel=follow>Kevin Wendt Engaged, Girlfriend, Family, Net Worth</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>At the time, Alyssa won the beauty pageant, she was 21 years old, and Torrance was a hunky Hollywood beau at the age of 28. After Alyssa was crowned Miss USA 2011, Torrance tweeted: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>'Pardon my French, but HOLY F***!

We’ve shared an incredible life together over the last 9 years…..we still love and respect each other very much…but the time has come to pursue new paths."</p><p style=text-align:justify>After the amicable split, the duo has focused its attention on their respective careers.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Is Torrance Dating? Gay?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>36-year-old Torrance is possibly single after the break up with his long-time sweetheart Alyssa.
