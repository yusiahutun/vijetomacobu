In 2016, he signed a multi-year deal with First Access Entertainment.</p><p>However, at least according to the allegations in the suit, the deal with First Access was not healthy for the rapper. The suit alleges that Stennett and her company “fostered, promoted and encouraged” drug use as a way to influence their client, the Times reported.</p><p>According to the suit, Stennett provided Peep with a gift bottle of pills during a group dinner in 2017 and the suit includes copies of text messages which it claims Stennett sent to the rapper that included an inventory of available drugs, allegedly writing “I’m about to land at JFK. I have one 2m x and 4 x .25,” apparently referring to Xanax.</p><p>The lawsuit also alleges that Mercer, while working as his tour manager, provided Lil Peep with controlled substances, including ketamine and cites an incident in 2017, just a few weeks before Peep’s overdose death, when Mercer was alleged to have been detained at the Canadian border after a search by drug-sniffing dogs.</p><p>The suit claims that Stennett was made aware of the incident, but took no corrective action.</p><p>“I wasn’t there,” Stennett told Rolling Stone in an interview. “Anybody who takes drugs makes a decision to take a risk.” She also claimed that and several other members of the team repeatedly told Lil Peep to seek counseling for substance abuse.</p><p>The defendants, including Stennett and First Access, did not immediately respond to the Times request for comment and no criminal charges have been filed in connection with the case.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZoZwfY9oZ3FnnJ65brzEnqesZZ2kwamx0Waqrp2jYrWqv4ymmKeZl5q6prrTZpqopaCWu7p5zq%2Bcq2WYnsBuwc2toKadnK56pbHArZ9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
