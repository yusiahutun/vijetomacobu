The latest relationship video that went viral, where it shows a ‘love surge’ left users of the social media platform with mixed opinions on it.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>TikTok</a> video made by the influencers Lilianna Wilde and Sean Kolar garnered a lot of reactions from their followers as they showed unusual ways of expressing love. While some users of the platform found it rather cute, others called it ‘cringe’ and lead to Lilianna’s breakdown in a different video.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-4.16.49-PM-664x1024.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-love-surge-tiktoker-breaks-down-in-tears>‘Love surge’ TikToker breaks down in tears</h2><p>TikTok can be an uplifting medium where <a href=#>influencers</a> showcase their unique tips and tricks in relationships that help them navigate personal dynamics better. But not all personal experiences get equally positive responses from users. ‘Love Surge’ TikToker <a href=# rel=nofollow>Lilianna Wilde</a> felt this quite personally after her latest viral video.</p><p>The TikToker seemed heartbroken over the negative comments on the video. She shared: “Some of the comments were really mean, they were like wishing like someone cheated on each other… and I think if the goal is to make me sad, you did it, you won.”</p><p>She urged her followers to be kinder, adding: “What I’m heartbroken over are the really awful things people are wishing on Sean and me. Please think before you type, I’m very, very lucky that my offline life is so wonderful that I can look away, but some people aren’t so lucky and for their sake please consider what you write.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-cringiest-thing-on-the-internet>The ‘cringiest’ thing on the Internet</h2><p>‘Love Surge’ is the latest couple term on TikTok, the ‘cringiest coupley’ thing on the internet.</p><p>The user explains a ‘love surge’ is essentially when one of the pair feels so much love that they feel like they are going to explode. To contain the feeling, they wrap their arms around the other person until they also feel the same, and then they ‘explode’ and shake with love together.</p><p>While the video received some mocking comments who could not relate to the emotions, others seemed to enjoy the playfulness.</p><p>One posted: “This is so sweet and fun. Playfulness in relationships are so important.”</p><p>Another similar comment read: “This is sweet. They’re full of love, and we can love as well as appreciate.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2aGcLjOr5xmq6WntKZ506Kiraebmr9urtGemKSrXZm8uLqMoqVmrJWWv7R5zq%2Bcq2WmnrmmedGemJysmaS7bsDOZp%2Beql2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
