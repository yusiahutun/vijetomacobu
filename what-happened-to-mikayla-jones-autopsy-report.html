It could only indicate that the medicines were present in the body.</p><p>"The drug concentrations recorded by the toxicology laboratory have no clinical relation since postmortem skeletal muscle, unlike blood, is not a clinically proven and validated matrix for interpretation," Turner's study stated.</p><p>"As a result, interpreting drug concentrations in postmortem skeletal muscle for intoxication or toxicity is scientifically and medically unjustified."</p><p>The pathologist stated that she discovered a linear skull fracture and left knee contusions. She said that because of the body's skeletonization (stage of decomposition), she couldn't tell whether the injuries occurred before or after Jones died.</p><p>"Microscopic inspection shows the existence of left knee contusions," Turner stated. "The fracture of the calvarium's inner table (cranium) may or may not signify antemortem (before death) damage."</p><p>Its existence, together with the circumstances surrounding Ms. Jones' disappearance and the environment in which her remains were recovered, strengthens the possibility of murder as the cause of death."</p><h2 id=mikayla-joness-family-are>Mikayla Jones's Family Are Still Seeking Answers On Her Death</h2><p>Mikayla Jones's family is still seeking justice for their daughter as well as the cause of her death.
