James Bryant, commander of a Thresher-class submarine, agreed that a series of events led to the sinking: The sub descended far too quickly without stopping to assess for leaks from previous shock testing months earlier; there were training concerns because the location of valves had changed while in dock; and ice buildup prevented the crew from effectively blowing the ballast tanks to resurface.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The main cooling pumps eventually stopped, followed by the nuclear reactor, robbing the submarine of the ability to stop its fatal descent, he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>No one will know for sure exactly how the disaster played out. But it's clear that precious minutes went by as the crew became aware of their dire situation.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At one point, a message from the submarine to a rescue ship referred to '900 north' suggesting the sub was 900 feet beyond its test depth, according to documents.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The test depth was redacted but previously declassified documents indicated it was 1,300 feet, said Norman Friedman, a naval analyst and author of more than 30 books on naval topics.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The documents reveal many of the submarine's safety systems were based on operations in shallower depths from previous-generation submarines, and were inadequate in the unlikely scenario of a loss of nuclear propulsion while deep underwater, Bryant said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That World War II mindset during the nuclear age proved fatal for the Thresher crew, he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At the time, the Navy's resources and personnel were strained as it pushed to get ballistic missile-equipped submarines deployed quickly to counter the Soviet missile threat, Friedman said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That contributed to veteran crew members being reassigned and new officers and sailors coming aboard who were less familiar with the Thresher's complicated system of pipes and valves before the fatal dive, he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It's almost a wartime situation and you might consider them casualties of the Cold War,' he said of the Thresher's crew.</p><img id=i-b276386902d66339 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/08/01/69425535-11933561-The_Navy_believes_the_Thresher_s_sinking_was_likely_caused_by_a_-a-2_1680912702153.jpg height=787 width=962 alt="The Navy believes the Thresher's sinking was likely caused by a burst pipe and electrical problems that led to a nuclear reactor shutdown" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The Navy believes the Thresher's sinking was likely caused by a burst pipe and electrical problems that led to a nuclear reactor shutdown</p><img id=i-59891eb9bbe3c7da src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/03/18/33658430-11933561-Emblem_adopted_in_1960_for_the_USS_Thresher-m-58_1680543460617.jpg height=962 width=962 alt="The emblem adopted in 1960 for the USS Thresher.&nbsp;The circles represent her sonar capability, while the motto 'Vis Tacita' describes the overall characteristics of the ship, 'Silent strength'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The emblem adopted in 1960 for the USS Thresher.&nbsp;The circles represent her sonar capability, while the motto 'Vis Tacita' describes the overall characteristics of the ship, 'Silent strength'</p><img id=i-e46d17e47cb3d40e src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/03/18/33658434-11933561-The_Navy_inquiry_found_weaknesses_in_the_design_and_construction-a-56_1680543385768.jpg height=748 width=962 alt="The sub's destruction caused the Navy to accelerate safety improvements and to create a program called SUBSAFE, an extensive series of design modifications, training and other improvements" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The sub's destruction caused the Navy to accelerate safety improvements and to create a program called SUBSAFE, an extensive series of design modifications, training and other improvements&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The sub's destruction caused the Navy to accelerate safety improvements and to create a program called SUBSAFE, an extensive series of design modifications, training and other improvements.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One submarine has sunk since then, the USS Scorpion in 1968, and it was not SUBSAFE-certified, the Navy said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Tim Noonis, whose father, a radio operator, perished on the Thresher, said the loss remains painful for families like his, but he finds comfort that the Navy corrected mistakes for the sake of future sailors.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'No one wants to lose a family member, but if other families have benefited, well, there´s some solace in that,' Noonis said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Noonis was born at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, where the Thresher was built.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Meanwhile Don Wise Jr of Plaistow, New Hampshire, who lost his dad, said the Thresher crew members were doing something special, serving on what was a technological marvel, the Navy's fastest and deepest-diving nuclear submarine.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'They were going deeper and faster than anyone.
