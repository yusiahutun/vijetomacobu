And, when it comes to tough calluses, corns, cracked skin, dry cuticles, and dead skin buildup at the feet, it is important to opt for a more robust form of physical exfoliation. This compelled me to look into the best pumice stones for feet, as it has been an age-old practice to use them in one’s skincare routine, and I wanted to explore more about them.</p><p>Pumice stones are excellent keratolytic tools for scuffing away tough layers of dead skin in the stratum corneum, thereby buffing the skin and smoothing its texture (study by <a href=#><u>JAAD</u></a>). Due to their porous nature, these rocks work extremely well when used with water and soap, as they help form a rich lather and scrape away stubborn impurities and stains off the skin. Several dermatological studies have used pumice stones extensively, in addition to chemical exfoliants like <a href=#><u>salicylic acid</u></a> to effectively treat skin issues such as corns and warts (research published on <a href=#><u>NCBI</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Besides, having inspected several types of callus removers in the past, such as stainless steel scrapers with horrifying, cheese-grater-like appearances, I deem pumice stones as a relatively gentle, safe, yet efficacious tool for exfoliating the feet. My list of recommendations below comprises some of the choicest products that offer varying levels of abrasion to suit different needs. I hope you like them!</p><p>Our top picks</p><p><h2 class=title>10 Best Pumice Stones for Feet to Get Rid of Dead Skin Cells</h2></p><p>Considering that this pumice stone by Maryton is a synthetic one, its construction and design are tailor-made to suit your skin needs, without the potential downsides of the real rock. I’m emphasizing this because the product is dual-textured, one side being more coarse and porous and the other fine and smooth. Hence, the former is perfect for sloughing the dead cells of the callused skin of your feet, while the latter is ideal for smoothening the surface of softer skin areas. This product is also very efficacious in the shower to invigorate the feet and breathe life into neglected skin areas.</p><p>Pros</p><ul class=pros_list><li>Individually-wrapped stones</li><li>Ergonomic</li><li>Easy to grip</li><li>Great addition to a pedicure gift kit</li><li>Gets rid of flaky skin</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul class=cons_list><li>Thinner than expected</li><li>May crumble a bit</li></ul><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/select/images/quick_tip_bulb_icon.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 class=exp-tip--head--style>Quick Tip:</h2><p class=exp--tip--content>For best results, use the coarser side of this stone on cracked heels, athlete’s foot, etc., while the skin is dry.

While this pumice stone isn’t a conventional volcanic rock, it has been customized with high-quality terra cotta that felt pleasantly cool against my skin, on use. The tool is dual-textured, consisting of a rough porous side and a smoothly sculpted buffing side. A USP of this product — it stays intact and effective for years, unlike cheaper synthetic alternatives you’ll find over the counter.</p><p>Pros</p><ul class=pros_list><li>Easy to hold</li><li>Easy to clean</li><li>Doesn’t slip away</li><li>Not too harsh on the skin</li><li>Ergonomic, contoured design</li><li>Smoothes skin texture</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul class=cons_list><li>Not very effective on calluses</li></ul><li class="product_info_li border_bottom" readability=-0.72222222222222><p>3</p><p>Best for Cracked Heels</p><a href=# rel=sponsored title="KuuCare Natural Lava Pumice Stone" onclick='triggerGA("Pv_Select","Article_Product_title","B01ERJ5FB8","-"),triggerBuyNow("select_buy_now",&#39;&#39;,"1276563","2024-02-06 13:55:16","Product Description","Article_page","/select/best-pumice-stone-for-feet-1276563","Select","Beauty","B01ERJ5FB8","KuuCare Natural Lava Pumice Stone","3","Product Title")' readability=2><p><h3>KuuCare Natural Lava Pumice Stone</h3></p></a><a href=# rel=sponsored title="KuuCare Natural Lava Pumice Stone" onclick='triggerGA("Pv_Select","Article_Product_Image","B01ERJ5FB8","-")'><img alt="KuuCare Natural Lava Pumice Stone" title="KuuCare Natural Lava Pumice Stone" width=auto height=auto onclick='triggerBuyNow("select_buy_now",&#39;&#39;,"1276563","2024-02-06 13:55:16","Product Description","Article_page","/select/best-pumice-stone-for-feet-1276563","Select","Beauty","B01ERJ5FB8","KuuCare Natural Lava Pumice Stone","3","Product Image")' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51WKagMPJML._SL500_.jpg></a></li><p>This volcanic pumice stone from KuuCare fits comfortably in my hand and offers impressive exfoliation for my feet. Owing to the numerous holes on its round, sculpted surface, this pumice rock cleanses the feet really well and prevents the overgrowth of bacteria. Besides, I found that it works really well with my body wash as its porous surface helps lather it. Also, is very effective in removing calluses, flakes, and cracked skin, thereby leaving you with smooth and sculpted feet.</p><p>Pros</p><ul class=pros_list><li>Doesn’t flake</li><li>Free suction hook</li><li>Useful for pedicures</li><li>Wear-proof holding rope</li><li>Fits easily in the palm</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul class=cons_list><li>Users find the suction unimpressive</li><li>Maintenance is a hassle</li></ul><li class="product_info_li border_bottom" readability=-0.5><p>4</p><p>Best Hypoallergenic</p><a href=# rel=sponsored title="Onyx Professional Buff & Polish Pumice Stone - Pack of 2" onclick='triggerGA("Pv_Select","Article_Product_title","B0B1N5VRSQ","-"),triggerBuyNow("select_buy_now",&#39;&#39;,"1276563","2024-02-06 13:55:16","Product Description","Article_page","/select/best-pumice-stone-for-feet-1276563","Select","Beauty","B0B1N5VRSQ","Onyx Professional Buff & Polish Pumice Stone - Pack of 2","4","Product Title")' readability=2><p><h3>Onyx Professional Buff & Polish Pumice Stone - Pack of 2</h3></p></a><a href=# rel=sponsored title="Onyx Professional Buff & Polish Pumice Stone - Pack of 2" onclick='triggerGA("Pv_Select","Article_Product_Image","B0B1N5VRSQ","-")'><img alt="Onyx Professional Buff & Polish Pumice Stone - Pack of 2" title="Onyx Professional Buff & Polish Pumice Stone - Pack of 2" width=auto height=auto onclick='triggerBuyNow("select_buy_now",&#39;&#39;,"1276563","2024-02-06 13:55:16","Product Description","Article_page","/select/best-pumice-stone-for-feet-1276563","Select","Beauty","B0B1N5VRSQ","Onyx Professional Buff & Polish Pumice Stone - Pack of 2","4","Product Image")' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51eOEAXpsWL._SL500_.jpg></a></li><p>The sleek construction of this pumice exfoliator from Onyx is a huge plus as it is easier to hold and maneuver, and covers larger skin areas when scrubbing. While its colored coarser side is excellent for sanding calluses and buffing cracks on the feet, the smoother white side is indeed great for exfoliating other areas on your legs. In my experience, I found this pumice stone quite easy to use and the fact that it is almost shatter-proof makes it very durable.

I would recommend this product to those with sensitive skin, who are skeptical of using a really hard tool against their skin, as this one is relatively softer. This synthetic pumice tool really helps get rid of dirt and grime and prevent the formation of calluses if you feel that your feet' skin has been neglected a lot lately!

With more consistent use, you may also be able to remove corns from your feet or at least reduce their appearance significantly. This product is a pocket-friendly investment as at just 4.38 dollars, you get two natural pumice rocks. Some customers also prefer using it for other skin areas, however, I would recommend doing that with caution as the results can vary on individual skin.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/select/images/quick_tip_bulb_icon.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 class=exp-tip--head--style>Quick Tip:</h2><p class=exp--tip--content>Soak your feet in warm water for 3-5 minutes before scrubbing with this pumice stone to get the best results!</p><p>Pros</p><ul class=pros_list><li>Comes with a hanging rope</li><li>Removes dirt stains</li><li>Sloughs dead skin effectively</li><li>Not too rough</li><li>Tapered edges</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul class=cons_list><li>Not durable</li></ul><li class="product_info_li border_bottom"><p>7</p><p>Easiest to Hold</p><a href=# rel=sponsored title="Pumice Valley Foot File" onclick='triggerGA("Pv_Select","Article_Product_title","B085955LFH","-"),triggerBuyNow("select_buy_now",&#39;&#39;,"1276563","2024-02-06 13:55:16","Product Description","Article_page","/select/best-pumice-stone-for-feet-1276563","Select","Beauty","B085955LFH","Pumice Valley Foot File","7","Product Title")'><p><h3>Pumice Valley Foot File</h3></p></a><a href=# rel=sponsored title="Pumice Valley Foot File" onclick='triggerGA("Pv_Select","Article_Product_Image","B085955LFH","-")'><img alt="Pumice Valley Foot File" title="Pumice Valley Foot File" width=auto height=auto onclick='triggerBuyNow("select_buy_now",&#39;&#39;,"1276563","2024-02-06 13:55:16","Product Description","Article_page","/select/best-pumice-stone-for-feet-1276563","Select","Beauty","B085955LFH","Pumice Valley Foot File","7","Product Image")' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Ej+BRz2HL._SL500_.jpg></a></li><p>Compared to others, this pumice tool for feet comes embedded in a handled filing tool, which makes it really comfortable to use and maneuver. Its holder is made with natural wood, and the hanging rope is of jute — a sturdy, naturally-made product. The file itself is made with pumice grit instead of the whole rock, and I really like this idea as this makes its exfoliation very efficient without the unnecessary harshness and abrasive side effects. This tool has a gentle, sandpaper-like effect on your feet, which makes it super-smooth and polished.</p><p>Pros</p><ul class=pros_list><li>Improves blood flow</li><li>Easy to use</li><li>Removes flakes</li><li>Reduces calluses</li><li>Ergonomic design</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul class=cons_list><li>A bit pricey</li><li>The grit starts to peel off</li></ul><li class="product_info_li border_bottom" readability=-0.49315068493151><p>8</p><p>Best Combo Kit</p><a href=# rel=sponsored title="EntreFeet Dr. Entre’s Callus Remover Kit" onclick='triggerGA("Pv_Select","Article_Product_title","B09BBLWZMW","-"),triggerBuyNow("select_buy_now",&#39;&#39;,"1276563","2024-02-06 13:55:16","Product Description","Article_page","/select/best-pumice-stone-for-feet-1276563","Select","Beauty","B09BBLWZMW","EntreFeet Dr. Entre’s Callus Remover Kit","8","Product Title")' readability=2><p><h3>EntreFeet Dr. Entre’s Callus Remover Kit</h3></p></a><a href=# rel=sponsored title="EntreFeet Dr. Entre’s Callus Remover Kit" onclick='triggerGA("Pv_Select","Article_Product_Image","B09BBLWZMW","-")'><img alt="EntreFeet Dr. Entre’s Callus Remover Kit" title="EntreFeet Dr. Entre’s Callus Remover Kit" width=auto height=auto onclick='triggerBuyNow("select_buy_now",&#39;&#39;,"1276563","2024-02-06 13:55:16","Product Description","Article_page","/select/best-pumice-stone-for-feet-1276563","Select","Beauty","B09BBLWZMW","EntreFeet Dr. Entre’s Callus Remover Kit","8","Product Image")' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51JAfWZURdL._SL500_.jpg></a></li><p>Here’s an ultimate callus remover kit for those who need intensive care for their feet, and I absolutely adore how harmoniously these products work. The kit comprises a dual-textured pumice stone for calluses, a stainless steel foot file, a callus–remover gel formula, a pack of 10 gloves, and a free foot care e-book that keeps your skincare game on its feet.&nbsp; Leaving the gel on your feet for about 5 minutes improves the pumice’s efficacy in removing calluses and corns.

The texture of this pumice rock is a lot coarser than most others, which makes it a robust tool against calluses, corns, and even the dried cuticle around the toes. And, for those who get really disgusted with the dirt and bacteria accumulated on the cracked skin of the feet, this tool scrapes them out effectively through the edges of its cavities.

Each enclosed stone has a uniform, compact size to fit easily into your palm and work efficiently on the skin.

While the former is ideal for abrading calluses, corns, and cracked and extremely dry skin, the latter helps with gentler exfoliation and buffing. Also, if you want to prevent calluses before they start to form properly, a smooth-textured pumice stone is preferable as it wouldn’t cut or abrade the skin more than it calls for. Some synthetic pumice rocks are double-textured, which can be used for both abrading and polishing in a more elaborate foot care routine.</p><p><strong>Consider the Source/Materials of the Stone</strong></p><p>Ideally, a pumice stone is of natural origin, formed out of volcanic lava. They are environmentally friendly and very durable, suitable to last for many years. However, as they are natural rocks, they are very abrasive in nature and are only suitable for severely dry, dead skin cells and tough calluses, as rubbing them on those areas won’t cause any pain.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, synthetic foot files, mimicking the same texture of natural pumice stones are becoming common these days. The best feature about synthetic ones is that they may comprise both hard and soft textures, catering to different skin needs. Some manmade pumice stones may still be composed of natural ingredients other than volcanic lava, such as the <a href=#><u>Gilden Tree Natural Terra Cotta Pumice Stone</u></a>, which is made with terra cotta.&nbsp;</p><p>Many artificial pumice stones work well with soaps and cleansers, to enhance the cleaning process. However, these products may or may not be good for the environment. So, depending on your specific needs, priorities, and complete knowledge about how the product was sourced/manufactured, you can choose to invest in one.</p><p><strong>Consider the Construction/Design</strong></p><p>Volcanic pumice stones are often naturally shaped like an egg or a sphere, and fit in an average-sized palm. However, some modern products use the finely crushed grit of pumice rocks and bake it evenly on the surface of a handled foot file, to enhance its functions and convenience. In the case of artificial pumice stones, they may consist of rounded, rectangular, cylindrical, and other miscellaneous designs. You should always invest in one that is easy to hold, grip, and maneuver and does not fatigue your hand.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Use a Pumice Stone?</h2></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by soaking your feet with warm, soapy water for about 5 to 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> This step is optional, but if you have a callus-remover gel handy, use it and leave the product on your skin for 3 to 5 minutes. Then, rinse it off.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pat your feet dry with a soft and clean towel.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Start by scrubbing the pumice stone in gentle, circular motions on the callused, cracked, or dried-out regions on your feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> If the stone has a smoother side to it, use it to buff the softer areas on your skin. If it doesn’t have a smoother side, use the same coarse-textured stone, but massage it gently on softer skin areas. Be sure to not put too much pressure on it.</p><p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Rinse the skin, and pat dry. Follow up with a rich moisturizer or salve.</p><p><h2 class=title>Tips for Prolonging the Life of a Pumice Stone:</h2></p><p><strong>1. Cleansing</strong></p><p>Pumice stones easily accumulate dead skin particles, bacteria, grime, germs, and other impurities after every use. Hence, it is important to scrape that out by scrubbing it with a bristled brush dipped into antibacterial soap. When rinsing it, ensure you get rid of any soap residue. Then, infuse the pumice stone in water mixed with an antiseptic solution to kill germs and prevent the outgrowth of bacteria. You can also choose to sterilize the pumice after every use.</p><p><strong>2. Drying</strong></p><p>It is very important to dry the pumice stone completely before storage, as any wet particles of the stone stored for a prolonged period can start to crack or flake. After rinsing, wrap the pumice in a super-absorbent towel and leave it there for 2-3 minutes. Then, place it on a clean, dry surface exposed to plenty of sunlight, and allow the pumice to air-dry.</p><p><strong>3. Proper Storage</strong></p><p>Unlike what you may have seen in some stock images on the internet, it is a bad idea to stack pumice stones on top of each other. This can cause the stones to chip or crack. Furthermore, avoid storing pumice stones in small cases or airtight containers, as the friction can cause them to damage. Instead, place them in a high-quality, sturdy, clean, and spacious container with a lid on it to ensure longevity. Also, store the pumices in a moderately cool, dry place and avoid exposing them to extreme temperatures.</p><p><strong>4. Ventilation</strong></p><p>It is also important to store the pumice in a highly ventilated space to prevent it from sweltering, as that would smooth out its edges and reduce its exfoliation prowess.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Even if you may have purchased the best pumice stone for feet, you will have to keep maintaining it and checking on it to see any chips, cracks, or other signs of deterioration — regardless of whether it is a natural product or a synthetic one. And, in case you find any, it is important to replace the tool from time to time. When investing in a new product, it is important to inspect its exfoliative abilities and ease of use. For robust exfoliation, I recommend products such as the <a href=#><u>Beauty by Earth Lava Exfoliating Pumice Stone</u></a>, and for gentle buffing, I recommend the <a href=#><u>Maryton Foot Pumice Stone</u></a> and the <a href=#><u>Pumice Valley Foot File</u></a>. I hope this article helps you. Happy shopping!</p><h2 class=title>FAQ's</h2><p>What are some hygiene protocols to follow when using a pumice stone?</p><p>Yes, there are several. After exfoliation, it is extremely important to cleanse and disinfect the stone with plenty of water and potent antibacterial/antiseptic solutions. Following this, it is important to air-dry the stone under natural sunlight, to ensure it is completely dry before storing.</p><p>How often should a pumice stone be replaced?</p><p>As the shelf-life of an average pumice stone is less, it is ideal to replace it every month. However, if your pumice is particularly durable, without bearing much impact on its exfoliation properties, its usage can be prolonged for another two weeks.</p><p>How often should I use a pumice stone on my feet?</p><p>Not more than 2-3 times a week.</p><p>Is it safe to use a pumice stone on sensitive skin or diabetic feet?</p><p>It is best to avoid using pumice stones on diabetic feet. Also, if you have sensitive skin, limit the pumice exfoliation to hardened regions of your feet only, such as calluses, corns, dry cuticles, and dead skin layers.</p><h2 class=title>Why Trust Pinkvilla</h2><p>Anoushka, the author of this article and our in-house skincare expert has interviewed several people who complained about their callused, dry, and dull feet.
