She had already started in the industry long before getting married to the actor.</p><p>Baumgartner has done some work as a model and actress in various movies and shows like <a href=#>Primetime</a> (1989), <a href=#>Die Johannes B. Kerner Show</a> (1998), and <a href=#>E! Live from the Red Carpet</a> (1995). She later got to know about her true passion -handbags and followed it.</p><p>Here we get to know more about Christine Baumgartner- <a href=#>Kevin Costner’s</a> wife, including her age, net worth, and wiki.</p><h3>Life History</h3><p>Christine Anne Baumgartner was born on May 4 in the year 1974. She is now (2022) 47 years old. She is from Los Angeles, California, with German and Swiss background.</p><p>Christine’s father is Jim Baumgartner, whereas there is no information about her mother. She has a sister Lily Baumgartner. Christine is quite smart and has done her undergraduate studies in Business at California State University, Fullerton. She was also doing modeling part-time along with her studies.</p><h2>Love life with Kevin Costner</h2><p>Kevin and his wife, Christine, met in the ’80s when Kevin was still married to Cindy Costner. They first met at a golf course. The couple has 20 years age difference. Costner and his spouse, Baumgartner, were colleagues as Christine worked as a professional model.</p><p>After a while in 1999, they crossed their ways in a restaurant where Kevin asked for Christine’s number. He told her that he would call in a week or so. They started seeing each other and later fell in love.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-5872 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kevin-Costner-wife-Christine-Baumgartner.jpg alt="Kevin Costner smiling with wife, Christine Baumgartner" width=766 height=560 sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-5872 class=wp-caption-text>Kevin Costner smiling with his wife, Christine Baumgartner</p><p>In 2003, Christine and Kevin had a minor setback as a couple. Kevin was not so sure about wanting kids and having a family, but Christine surely wanted one. Kevin thought that he would not be a good dad and wouldn’t be able to see his children grow as he was getting old.</p><p>However, Christine told Kevin that she would wait for him but not for long. Later, Kevin decided that he didn’t want to throw such a good relationship and person for a silly reason, and they got back together.</p><p>On 2004, September 25, after ups and downs in their relationship, Costner and Baumgartner got married. They held the ceremony in Aspen, Colorado, in their house with 400 guests. The couple made a magnificent entrance at their wedding. Kevin entered in a vintage green vehicle, whereas Christine entered in a horse-drawn carriage. It was a fairytale come true.</p><h2>Children</h2><p>Although having thoughts about starting a family, Kevin and his partner, Christine, welcomed their first child in 2007. They named their first son Cayden Wyatt Costner (May 6, 2007). Wanting to have a bigger family, the couple welcomed two more children. The middle child Hayes Logan Costner (February 12, 2009), and the youngest, Grace Avery Costner (June 2, 2010).</p><p>The happy couple still lives together and raises their children out of the limelight. The family sometimes makes appearances in different movie premieres and red carpet.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-5873 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kevin-Costner-wife-Christine-Baumgartner-children.jpg alt="Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner children" width=700 height=540 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-5873 class=wp-caption-text>Kevin Costner, along with his wife, Christine Baumgartner, and children</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Kevin’s wife started her career as a model but later chose to design stylish carrying handbags.
