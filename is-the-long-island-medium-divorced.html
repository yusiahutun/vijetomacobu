The two had a fun relationship together, and their tight knit family — which includes kids Victoria and Larry Jr. — seemed unbreakable. That's why fans were shocked when they announced their separation in 2017.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Larry soon spoke out about why he and his wife were ending their marriage after 28 years, and he said that things became tense when she was focusing so much time on the show.</p><p>“I think a lot of the frustration has to do with us not spending the time together anymore," he had said on the show. "Along with that comes the lack of communication so it’s like losing your best friend. It’s hard.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In December of 2018, the couple officially divorced, with Theresa confirming the news to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.</p><p>“Larry and I have finalized our divorce.

"But I’ll just leave it [at that] for now.”</p><p>Connie and Larry apparently met when the Alabama native reached out to Theresa to get a reading.
