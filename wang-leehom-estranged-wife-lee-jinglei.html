Some brands have since halted advertisement cooperation with Wang. The couple filed for divorce last month.</p><p>According to their divorce agreement, approval must be obtained from both parties if either of them wants to bring someone outside the family during child visitations, said Lee.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/12/839e774a-8d63-47c0-b9b0-50fd0c63b065_20df0c07.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She claimed Wang also asked her to turn off home surveillance equipment before he entered the house, which she said she refused to do.</p><p>“I felt it was strange and started to feel afraid. I told you there is only me, three children and a female maid at home. Your actions have made me feel frightened,” Lee wrote on Weibo.</p><p>She said Wang had told her he was only accompanied by two male staffers, but looking at camera surveillance, she saw a third man standing behind Wang. Lee said she had never seen the man before.</p><p>“Your staffers even instructed him to stand behind a bit further. This made me extremely horrified,” said Lee.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Wang Leehom scandal: how the singer and actor went from golden boy to social pariah</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee alleged that when Wang found he couldn’t open the door with his key, he kept on banging on the door.</p><p>“Luckily we have locked the door from inside. Otherwise, I don’t know what else you would do,” said Lee. “The kids were all crying when they saw this. My hands couldn’t stop shaking.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/12/c3e94fc9-6e92-49c0-9a22-a727271dd2ab_482048aa.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She alleged Wang had previously told her that his closest staffer had a criminal record. She further alleged that same man has contacted her, asking to meet her personally, wrote Lee.</p><p>Lee also accused Wang’s company of spreading rumours that she might commit suicide. She denied this was the case by saying: “if anything happens to me, it definitely won’t be suicide.”</p><p>Wang’s agency responded to the accusations by saying that his lawyer had advised him not to visit the children alone. Instead, there must be a third party present.</p><p>“Because of the resistance from Lee Jinglei, Wang Leehom didn’t manage to see his children. Wang Leehom is very sad. He missed his children so much but he couldn’t hug them,” the agency said in a statement, news portal sohu.com reported.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/12/21/leehom_web_plain.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:43</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Wang Leehom divorce drama prompts warning by China’s Communist Party to Chinese celebrities</p><p>Wang Leehom divorce drama prompts warning by China’s Communist Party to Chinese celebrities</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It claimed the three men accompanying Wang were an assistant who has worked for the couple for the last 12 years, an employee who has worked with the company for 11 years and a bodyguard.</p><p>Taipei police said Lee called them on Sunday afternoon after Wang left to report the incident.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0minnqegobJur9Slq66qlWSwqbXNmmSpnaKovK%2Bty6Krop2jZK6zwMico55nY2aDdHyXcmawmZ6ceq2xxKGmpmWVqMGzrc2gnJ1lp56zpnnLnpxmopmjtK2xyA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
