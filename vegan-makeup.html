We’re reading labels on packages of pastas and shampoos, and our browser tabs are filled with Google searches like what is glycerin and how many trans fats are in french fries. And that’s a good thing!</p>Read More<p>When it comes to beauty products, everyone has their own criteria about what’s healthiest to put on their skin, hair, and nails. For some, <a rel=noopener href=#>clean beauty products</a> (free of toxins) are preferred, while others opt for <a href=#>natural makeup and skincare</a> (sourced from nature).</p><p>But lately, it’s <a rel=noopener href=#>vegan makeup</a> that’s creating all the buzz in the beauty world. What makes vegan makeup vegan, you might ask? Vegan products don’t contain animal by-products, and they omit toxic chemicals like heavy metals, sodium lauryl sulfate, polyethylene, petroleum distillates, and parabens. (Believe it or not, those are common ingredients in many beauty products!)</p><p><strong>Sephora has a great selection of <a rel=noopener href=#>vegan makeup for women over 50</a>, from anti-aging primers and foundations to lipsticks and mascaras. Here are our favorites.</strong></p><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow"><strong>Farsáli Rose Gold Elixir</strong></a></h2><span class=block-product__eyebrow>best vegan beauty oil</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/07/40.png><p><strong>$54, </strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Sephora</strong></a></p><p>As we age, our skin loses its natural moisture, which leads to wrinkles and creases. <a href=#>Beauty oils</a> are like super-moisturizers that provide hydration for your face, lips, and neck. <a rel=noopener href=#>This one</a> is infused with 24-karat gold flakes that emit a natural-looking glow, and it’s rich in vitamins, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids to visibly brighten and improve skin’s texture.</p><p><strong>Owner reviews:</strong></p><p>“I have severely dry skin all year round, and this has been a game changer for my skin. I absolutely recommend this for a face oil, or adding some to your foundation.”</p><p>“I’ve seen this all over Instagram used by a lot of MUA’s and finally decided to try it. This product is amazing for dry skin! I’ve been having trouble with foundation making my skin even more dry. I’ve been using Tarte’s oil but it always makes me feel greasy and it smells like french fries.

I am impressed, this product gave great, natural coverage and did not cause my face to break out.“</p><p>“I am a 56 year old (but very cool) woman who underwent chemo 18 months ago. Ever since then, my skin has been broken out with acne above and below the skin… I tried at least five mineral makeups thinking that was the better way to go. I ordered this makeup the other day and received it on last Thursday. All I can say is my skin has already cleared up – it’s a miracle. Great coverage and I use the ivory.
