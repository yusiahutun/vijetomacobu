But for some in the South, his image seems more beauty regime than evil regime.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kim-themed moisturising face masks have been flying off the shelves in South Korea’s beauty-obsessed capital amid growing speculation the North Korean leader will visit Seoul this month.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The “Unification Moisture Nuclear Masks” feature an image of Kim on the packaging and are printed with propaganda-style slogans such as “All hail moisture for all women of the North and South!” and “Baekdu Mountain spring water makes skin strong!”</p>Manufactured by a South Korean skincare firm called 5149, the masks were launched in June, shortly after the Inter-Korean summits between Kim and his southern counterpart <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Moon Jae-in</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since then, according to South Korean media, more than 25,000 of the masks – which cost 4,000 won (US$3.5) each – have been sold.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The masks are widely available at Pierrot Shopping, a discount retailer under Emart, South Korea’s largest retailer.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">When will Kim Jong-un visit Seoul?

She feared the masks could become propaganda for the North Korean regime, likening them to US President <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Donald Trump</span></a>’s Make America Great Again products.“A few years ago, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">North Korea</span></a> was the largest threat to our country … Kim Jong-un was seen as a dictator and a tyrant who would stop at nothing to disrupt world peace, now he’s become the face of a popular face mask,” she said.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Speaking positively of the North Korean government remains illegal in the South under a 1948 law which prohibits “praising, inciting or propagating the activities of an anti-government organisation”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But despite this – and the fact the two nations are technically still at war, having entered into a longstanding armistice since 1953 – Kim’s popularity has been on the increase since the summits with Moon in April and May.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">South Koreans on Twitter called the North Korean leader “cute” and “funny” as he made “finger hearts” symbols while posing alongside Moon at Mount Baekdu in September.
