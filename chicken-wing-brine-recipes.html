No matter what variety you prefer, there’s one secret that guarantees delicious results: brining the chicken wings, which allows the meat to sit in a salt mixture for anywhere from an hour to overnight before cooking. The wings end up juicy, well-seasoned and crispy — it’s the perfect trio of tastes and textures. If you’re new to brining, we’ve got tried-and-true chef’s tips alongside tasty chicken wing recipes. Here’s what you should know in order to make the ultimate chicken wing brine.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why it’s worth brining chicken wings</h2><p>Like any poultry, chicken wings can dry out quickly during cooking. This is due to the dual-process of cooking the meat while trying to get the skin super crispy. Luckily, brining prevents dry chicken wings, regardless of the cooking method used, thanks to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">salt’s reaction with the meat</a>. “It dissolves protein in muscle, and the salt and protein reduce moisture loss during cooking,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Sams, PhD</a>, food science expert and provost for Texas A&M University, explains. “This makes the meat juicier, more tender and improves the flavor.”</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Although salt is essential for improving the meat’s texture, brines often contain sugar and other seasonings for extra flavor and to help the skin brown evenly. One thing to keep in mind about brining is the type you’ll use to create a mouthwatering batch of chicken wings.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wet vs. dry chicken wing brine</h2><p>When brining, you’ll either use a wet or dry mixture to achieve your desired results. Here, <a href=#>Norah Clark</a>, chef and food editor for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Boyd Hampers</a>, explains the difference between the two brines and which to choose before cooking wings.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>For the juiciest meat: Use a wet brine</h3><p>In a wet brine, chicken wings are soaked in a solution of salt, water, sugar, herbs and spices. The wings sit in the liquid for several hours, which infuses lots of moisture into the meat that stays throughout the cooking process.&nbsp;That said, it’s key to fully dry the brined wings before cooking so the skin crisps up properly.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>For the fastest flavor: Use a dry brine</h3><p>Dry brining involves rubbing the wings with a mixture of salt and seasonings before letting them rest in the refrigerator. This method draws out moisture from the meat and skin, which&nbsp;mixes with the dry brine to&nbsp;create a flavorful liquid. Dry brining can be done in as little as an hour while yielding delicious meat and even crispier skin compared to wet brining.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to make a chicken wing brine</h2><p>You only need a handful of ingredients to brine chicken wings to flavorful and succulent perfection. Below, you can find two brine recipes (one wet, one dry) to try whenever you’re baking, deep-frying, grilling or air-frying wings.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Wet Chicken Wing Brine</h3><p>This recipe is courtesy of Clark. Her top tip:<strong> </strong>Experiment with various brine seasonings. “Get creative with your brine by adding ingredients like citrus zest,&nbsp;fresh herbs, hot sauce, soy sauce or honey to achieve different flavor&nbsp;profiles,” she suggests.</p><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>4 cups water&nbsp;</li><li>¼ cup kosher salt&nbsp;</li><li>¼ cup granulated or brown sugar, packed</li><li>2 cloves garlic, smashed&nbsp;</li><li>2 bay leaves&nbsp;</li><li>1 tsp. black peppercorns&nbsp;</li><li>1 lb. chicken wings, cut through center joint to separate drumettes</li></ul><p><strong>Directions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Active:</strong> 10 mins</li><li><strong>Total time: </strong>10 mins + brine time</li></ul><li>Place chicken wings into large, sturdy plastic bag or airtight container with lid. In large bowl, whisk together remaining ingredients until salt and sugar dissolve.</li><li>Carefully pour brine over chicken wings and mix around so meat is submerged. Cover or seal container tight to block out excess air. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.&nbsp;Remove wings from brine and discard liquid.</li><li>Rinse off saltwater and pat chicken wings completely dry. Proceed with your preferred recipe. (<strong>Note: </strong>Double or triple measurements as needed for larger amounts of wings.)</li><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Dry Chicken Wing Brine</h3><p>This recipe is courtesy of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeremy Pike</a>, author and recipe creator at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Angry BBQ</a>. He notes to be wary of overdoing it with certain kinds of salt. “If you&nbsp;use table salt or fine sea salt, you’ll want to go easy on the amount as it&nbsp;will make the wings really salty,” he notes.</p><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>Salt (Kosher, coarse or fine sea salt or table salt)</li><li>Additional seasonings like garlic powder, ground sage or dried rosemary, optional</li><li>2 lbs. chicken wings, separated</li></ul><p><strong>Directions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Active:</strong> 5 mins</li><li><strong>Total time: </strong>5 mins + brine time</li></ul><li>Place wings on wire rack set on top of baking sheet, leaving plenty of space between each one. Sprinkle both sides of wings with enough salt to evenly coat surface. Add other seasonings on top of salt layer (if using).</li><li>Refrigerate uncovered for at least 1 hour or up to overnight. Then, take the chicken out of fridge and begin preparing them according to recipe. (<strong>Note: </strong>You don’t have to rinse the wings as the dry brine will penetrate the meat.)</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2 delicious chicken wing recipes</h2><p>Brining is easy to do prior to whipping up your favorite chicken wing recipe.
