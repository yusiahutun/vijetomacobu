He is a gamer and an entrepreneur who is the CEO of Tempo Storm. One of the things that make him stand out from the crowd of many other players is that he is not only interested in streaming games, but also in competitive games, something he has also made a name for himself with.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Reynad Biography (Age)</strong></h2><p>While he is known in the world of gambling and often in the business world as Reynad, he was born on January 27, 1992, in Ukraine as Andrey Yanyuk. There he spent the first six years of his life before moving to the United States with his mother and brother. They settled in Minnesota.</p><p>He was raised exclusively by his mother, as his father had never been there in his history. As a small child, his interest was so great to play Nintendo 64s and Gameboys, which he got from neighbors and friends. At the age of 13, he took it a little further than playing programming because he dreamed of making games.</p><p>When he was 15 years old, he returned to his home country but did not forget to play. Soon he was introduced to Magic: The Gathering, the game for which he would first become famous. Later he returned to the States and took gambling, which was later extended to poker, even more seriously.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Heidi Van Pelt Biography, Facts To Know About Taran Noah Smith’s Ex-Wife</a></strong></p><p>As he spent more time in the card store than in the classroom, his high school education suffered a little, but later he took online courses to get back the two years of credit he was missing.</p><p>When he was 18, he left home and continued to play before he later started streaming Magic on Twitch. He was a big name on the platform until he was suspended and then suspended for cheating during a game. Although the ban was only for 18 months, he decided to stop playing altogether.</p><p>He started streaming on Twitch in 2012, and by the end of 2013, he had already come a long way and had collected tens of thousands of viewers. He already received offers from various companies to play for them. The problem was that they didn’t offer much in compensation, because he was only earning 2000 dollars a month.
