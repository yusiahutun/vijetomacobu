However, here are a few ways to help you out:</p><p class=align-left><strong>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish? Please reach us through news@tuko.co.ke or WhatsApp: 0732482690.</strong></p><h3>Define your personal style</h3><p class=align-left>A personal style is a particular way of expressing yourself through aesthetic choices like your clothing, accessories, <a href=#>hairstyle</a>, and how you put an outfit together. You do not need the latest fashion trends to be boujee.</p><p class=align-left>Instead, you need to develop a sense of self or a boujee dress code rather than absorb trends. For example, look at your closet and think of clothes that make you happy. Also, find fashion inspiration from experts and then create a wardrobe of things you can mix and match to create effortless looks.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b5c4abab8ef231e6.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>70+ African straight dress styles for funerals for 2022</span></p></a><h3>Eliminate all tired items</h3><p class=align-left>You cannot be boujee if you keep on the stain-covered t-shirt or the worn-out dress. Even the socks with holes will make you cheap. So get rid of all tired items from your wardrobe and give yourself a chance to fill it with classy items.</p><h3>Invest in basic items</h3><p class=align-left>Once you define your personal style, it is time to invest in items you think will bring out the best in you. Go for the basics or buy items that will not run out of style. A watch, eyeglasses, white t-shirts, blazers, and a pair of jeans are classic and timeless pieces that can get you started.</p><h3>Shop at discount stores</h3><p class=align-left>Another way to be boujee on a budget is to shop at discount stores. Discount stores have many stylish items that you can use to mix and match with others you have created in your wardrobe to look fashionable. As a result, you will spend less <a href=#>money</a> on high-quality items you love.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs66n7d7su2ec.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Latest Nigerian Ankara designs</span></p></a><h2>How to look boujee on a budget</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1a31a58f44080ce9.jpg><p class=align-left>Now that you know how to be boujee on a budget, the next step is to figure out how to look boujee on a budget. In other words, what are you going to wear to look classy? Here are some seven tips to help you look classy without breaking a sweat or the bank.</p><h3>1. Go for fitting clothes</h3><p class=align-left>You can change your style on a budget by simply wearing great fitting clothes. Fitting clothes are those that conform to your shape with the right amount of room to allow you to breathe. Baggy or loose clothes make you look sloppy, self-absorbed, and are less attractive.</p><p class=align-left>If you have bought loose-fitting clothes, take them to the tailor to trim them. You will look classy if the hems skim your ankles correctly. Also, ensure that the seams do not pull and that the sleeves do not roll.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs2bl5hj4kpd8g.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Beautiful kitenge dresses for every occasion 2021</span></p></a><h3>2. Wear neutral colour clothes</h3><p class=align-left>The best boujee outfits are neutral in colour, primarily beige, white, black, and brown. Neutral colours look expensive and make you look good when you wear them. An advantage of neutral colours is that they never go out of style and are always classy.</p><p class=align-left>Black is the top neutral colour you should pick if you are a woman. However, you can try mixing it up a bit with white. For example, consider the radiance-boosting effects of a white blouse, sweater, or jacket instead of wearing matching black when the chills set.</p><h3>3. Wear monochromatic outfits</h3><p class=align-left>You may have noticed that many celebrities pull out a pair of black pants, a black top and throw atop a black blazer. That is a monochromatic outfit because it is an ensemble whereby you wear one colour look. However, monochromatic <a href=#>dressing</a> can make you look expensive on a budget if you get it correctly.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs5kugoa216t2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cool official dresses in Kenya designs you must rock</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You do not have to be boring when wearing monochromatic outfits. For example, you can spice it up by mixing different textures or injecting some prints and patterns, such as Plaid pants, floral tops, gingham blazers, or leopard prints.</p><h3>4. Choose colours that go well together</h3><p class=align-left>A unique way of dressing on a budget is to wear colours that go well together. Unfortunately, determining two different colours can be challenging. Ideally, contrasting and complementary colours go well together.</p><p class=align-left>For example, a dark blue dress accented with orange booties feels current, stylish, and fun. But if you feel wearing two colours in an outfit is nerving, consider decreasing the intensity of one of the colours with texture.</p><h3>5. Wear glasses to go with your outfit</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b5c4abab8ef231e6.png><p class=align-left>The general perception is that glasses make you look smarter. But glasses can also make you look expensive. However, the type of glasses you wear will determine whether people will see you as classy. For example, a shape like cat-eye or oval has a personality and charm that keeps them permanently in the spotlight.</p><p class=align-left>Ideally, go for glasses with textures like clear and tortoise to add a bold touch to your eyeglasses. However, it is also helpful to choose understated colours like black when wearing glasses. Another point to note is that the glasses should match your face tones easily.</p><h3>6. Match your accessories</h3><p class=align-left>Accessorising your outfit is one critical step that can make you stand out from the rest. You have unlimited options when it comes to accessorising your dress. Ideally, you have to match your accessories with the colour of your outfit.</p><p class=align-left>For example, if you wear a light pink dress, choose a pink or rose-coloured accessory. Alternatively, you can match an accessory based on a specific detail on your outfit. For example, if your dress has a yellow flower, choose a yellow purse. Also, consider wearing neutral accessories with a bright dress.</p><h3>7. Wear pointy shoes</h3><p class=align-left>Wearing pointy shoes will make you look lean and expensive. However, you have to do it correctly to look classy. For example, wear pointed <a href=#>shoes</a> with pencil A-line and knee-length skirts. If the shoes are not pointy on the toes, go for the one with a pointy heel.</p><p class=align-left>When somebody asks you how to look boujee on a budget, they want to look classy without spending much. That starts with defining your style and then buying items that go with it. Then, when wearing your clothes, ensure they fit or put on neutral colours. Of course, you can also wear monochromatic outfits, dress in one colour, wear glasses, or match your accessories.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke </a>shared an interesting article on the tips and qualities on<a href=#> how to be a classy woman</a>.
