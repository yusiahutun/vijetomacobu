Plenty of <u></u>recent launches boast cannabis sativa on the front of their labels and questionable ingredients on the back: <a href=# class="css-1gunp80 emevuu60">mineral oils</a>, PEGs, <a href=# class="css-1gunp80 emevuu60">undisclosed fragrances</a>, known <a href=# class="css-1gunp80 emevuu60">skin sensitizers</a>, and more. “Because CBD has been positioned almost as a hero ingredient, I do feel like there’s a disconnect between it being one of many botanicals in a product, versus it being the highlighted ingredient in a sea of potentially harmful industrial compounds,” Jessica Assaf, the cofounder and chief education officer of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.sephora.com/brand/prima data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CBD skincare brand Prima" data-vars-ga-product-id=33fc2297-f242-4b0e-b870-845f7e6b4c47 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.sephora.com/brand/prima data-product-url=https://www.sephora.com/brand/prima data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=2417&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fbrand%2Fprima&u1=har|xid:{xid}" data-affiliate-network='{"id":"c919a546-ae14-41b0-a157-758886285c2c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{"trackonomics":{"merchant_id":"689251","merchant_name":"Sephora.com, Inc.","network_name":"LS","network_id":"4","product_id":"459","product_name":"Harper&#39;s BAZAAR US","product_external_id":"459","product_url":null}},"network":{"id":"a332915a-6423-480f-9153-e3973f438607","name":"Trackonomics","metadata":{}},"product_metadata":{"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5":{"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=2417&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fbrand%2Fprima&u1={subid}","network_name":"ls","appended_link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=2417&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fbrand%2Fprima&u1={subid}|xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2023-09-15 04:10:38.464183"}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=4c313fff-e992-44d3-809f-eb1422205c28 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090"><u>CBD skincare brand Prima</u></a>, tells BAZAAR.com.</p><img alt="medical cannabis leaf over a white background" title="Medical cannabis leaf over a white background" width=4032 height=3024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/medical-cannabis-leaf-over-a-white-background-royalty-free-image-1594751673.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Cappi Thompson</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Assaf is more intimately acquainted with said harmful industrial compounds than most. As a teenager, she cofounded the activist organization Teens for Safe Cosmetics and advocated for clean beauty before “clean beauty” was a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.fastcompany.com/90227521/the-global-beauty-business-goes-au-naturel data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$25 billion-a-year" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>$25 billion-a-year</u></a> category. In 2008, Assaf participated in the Environmental Working Group’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ewg.org/enviroblog/2014/07/teen-body-burden-where-are-they-now data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Teen Body Burden study" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Teen Body Burden study</u></a>. “My blood and urine were [tested], and 13 of 30 industrial compounds were found in my body,” she says; including those commonly found in cosmetics, like phthalates and parabens. “I finally had evidence to say that this matters, and we have control over some of these things in terms of the products we use.” After the study was complete, “the EWG remained instrumental in my early work of trying to compel companies to reformulate,” she notes. “We convinced O.P.I. to remove <a href=# class="css-1gunp80 emevuu60">formaldehyde-releasing preservatives</a> [from its nail polish].”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">More than a decade later, the teen activist-turned-clean beauty cofounder is once again partnering with the nonprofit; this time, to announce Prima as the first hemp CBD brand to earn the rigorous <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ewg.org/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="EWG Verification" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>EWG Verification</u></a> on its skincare products.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“To me, it’s a safety stamp,” says Assaf—a safety stamp that some say is much needed in an industry that operates on a post-market regulatory system and profits off manipulative marketing claims.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“There is nobody enforcing what it means to be clean, nontoxic, or safe,” clarifies Laurel Angelica Myers, Prima’s cofounder and COO. “It’s not something the Food and Drug Administration has defined, and brands can use [those terms] in their marketing in any which way they please.” (See also: the above greenwashing.) “That’s why it’s really important for us to partner with independent, third-party, trusted advocacy groups and nonprofits to provide credibility for what we say that we’re doing,” says Myers.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What is the EWG?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Clean beauty enthusiasts likely already know and trust the EWG, or the Environmental Working Group: It’s the organization behind the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Skin Deep cosmetics database" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Skin Deep cosmetics database</u></a>, a running master list of cosmetic ingredients and corresponding safety studies that consumers can cross-check with their personal care products. “The Skin Deep database was my own aha moment,” Myers tells BAZAAR. “The EWG opened people’s eyes to the fact that there are ingredients available on the market that pose human health and safety risks, and Skin Deep offers an easy way to understand and assess and make smarter choices.”</p><img alt="cannabis leaf on pink background, copy space" title="Cannabis leaf on pink background, copy space" width=1416 height=2124 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cannabis-leaf-on-pink-background-copy-space-royalty-free-image-1594751863.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Westend61</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But where Skin Deep relies on generalized ingredient data, the EWG Verified certification zeroes in on specific products from specific brands, taking into account everything from where the exact materials are sourced, to how the ingredients are processed, to the concentrations in the finished formulas. “Their team then has a team of toxicologists that goes through and assesses everything and identifies where these ingredients fall on the health and safety spectrum,” Myers explains. (The EWG looks to stricter international governing bodies, like Japan’s Ministry of Health and Health Canada, for guidance.) “There’s an additional documentation review where we provide concentrations of our ingredients, spec sheets, certificates of analysis, sometimes even process flow to look at potential contamination of ingredients,” the Prima COO shares.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In order to meet EWG Verified requirements, products must have a low-risk score of one or two (out of 10) in the Skin Deep database, and brands must disclose “additional information not typically found on the product label in an effort to drive the market toward greater transparency,” notes the brand. For example, the EWG requires that brands share their fragrance components—typically protected by FDA legislation around “proprietary” information—before they can be verified.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So what does this mean for customers? Basically, that when you see the EWG Verified mark on a product, you can rest assured that every single ingredient inside has been sufficiently vetted for safety (so you don’t have to do it yourself). This is especially appealing in the very trendy, often confusing, still evolving category of CBD skincare.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How Prima Is Redefining Clean CBD</h2><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Hemp is a bioaccumulator, it’s known to soak up heavy metals from the soil.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Because Prima is the first CBD skincare brand to be EWG Verified, the nonprofit was tasked with gathering and analyzing all the available research on the recently popularized ingredient. “As with all new ingredients, EWG conducted a thorough review to determine if this ingredient has been flagged as being linked to adverse health or environmental impacts in the scientific literature or by any national and international authoritative bodies,” Nneka Leiba, vice president of Healthy Living Science at EWG, tells BAZAAR.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Two main areas of concern were identified: bioaccumulation in the hemp plants CBD is derived from and the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Hemp is a bioaccumulator, it’s known to soak up heavy metals from the soil,” Christopher Gavigan, the co-founder and CEO of Prima and an environmental scientist by training, tells BAZAAR. “That’s the big unknown in this category.” To make sure its full-spectrum hemp CBD is free from potentially toxic heavy metals, Prima sources its hemp from a “multigeneration cohort of family farmers” in the United States that farms organically, conducts microbiological testing for contaminants, and is certified by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://detoxproject.org/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Detox Project" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>The Detox Project</u></a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Cannabidiol may contain elevated levels of tetrahydrocannabinol, which has been flagged as concerning by the FDA, the European Union, and Canadian government,” Leiba adds. “To account for this, EWG established a restriction on this ingredient for the Verified program. Our current restriction on THC content is 10 ppm, which is based on the restrictions from Health Canada.” Full-spectrum hemp generally contains only trace amounts of THC anyway (the compound is more concentrated in marijuana), which Prima further removes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The brand hopes the EWG Verified mark reassures cautious customers that its CBD is not only safe, but also worth slathering all over your face.</p><img alt="prima clean cbd ewg" title="prima clean cbd ewg" width=6023 height=4015 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/01-ewg-products-01-1-1594751550.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">ELENA KULIKOVA</span></p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How CBD Soothes Skin</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The cannabinoids in full-spectrum hemp, including CBD, work with the body’s endocannabinoid system, which is a system of receptors all throughout the body,” Assaf explains. “It’s activated on demand when we’re hit with a stressor and our body needs to maintain homeostasis—it’s the master regulatory system in that it promotes balance. The metaphor I like to use for the skin, which has its own endocannabinoid system, is that it’s like a lock-and-key system. So the endocannabinoids that the body produces kind of perfectly connect to the phytocannabinoids found in the plant to promote balance.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Early studies show that, in terms of skin care, “balance” might look like optimized oil production, fewer breakouts, and less redness and irritation—although the research on topical CBD isn’t as robust as the research on ingestibles. “People are still trying to understand what it is and what it isn’t,” Gavigan says. “It’s really been in a fear-based prohibition for almost 100 years.”</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Clean CBD Is a Social Justice Issue</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, that “fear-based prohibition” was largely the result of hemp’s proximity to marijuana (both plants belong to the cannabis family), and it’s impossible to talk about CBD without acknowledging the racial injustice within the cannabis industry. “We know in general that Black and white people use cannabis in equal amounts, yet Black people are incarcerated almost <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.aclu.org/gallery/marijuana-arrests-numbers data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="four times more" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>four times more</u></a> than white people,” says Gavigan. (Gavigan, Assaf, and Myers are all white.) “That bears on our soul. We will and absolutely must address that.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>It’s impossible to talk about CBD without acknowledging the racial injustice within the cannabis industry.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One way the brand is giving back to the Black community is by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.prima.co/giving/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="donating 1 percent of its annual revenue" data-vars-ga-product-id=ac8c0609-a71d-48a9-959c-28a0e9913df3 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.prima.co/giving/ data-product-url=https://www.prima.co/giving/ data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=2905762c-0412-4f23-a709-cba6ee7f2612 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090"><u>donating 1 percent of its annual revenue</u></a> to charitable causes, including the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.childrenandnature.org/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Children & Nature Network" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Children & Nature Network</a> in support of its Youth Outdoor Equity Leadership Fund. “This fund will support young leaders from the BIPOC and other marginalized communities working to increase equitable access to the benefits of nature, environmental and climate justice, and community health and well-being," the brand notes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To Assaf, Prima’s work with the EWG is the work of social justice. “The EWG is trying to protect the most vulnerable consumers,” she muses—and within the beauty industry specifically, the most vulnerable consumers are consumers of color. A <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ewg.org/research/big-market-black-cosmetics-less-hazardous-choices-limited data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="study from the EWG" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>study from the EWG</u></a> found that one in 12 beauty products marketed to Black women contain toxic substances, some associated with reproductive damage, with less than 25 percent of products in the space considered low hazard. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/permanent-hair-dye-straighteners-may-increase-breast-cancer-risk data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="A 2019 study" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>A 2019 study</u></a> showed that hair dyes and chemical straighteners are associated with a 60 percent increase in breast cancer risk for Black women compared to an 8 percent increase increase for white women. “We all have our own individual tipping point, so for someone out there, the EWG may be that safety net and protection,” says Assaf.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Consumers need guardians and protectors and peace of mind and champions of their health,” Gavigan agrees. “They aren’t weekend toxicologists, they shouldn't be required to look up ingredients.
