That arrest was the result of information that was provided by Sgt. J.D. Carter of the Jones County Sheriff’s Department, who handled Frazier’s case last April.</span></p><p dir=ltr><span>An informant provided Carter with a video that shows a “very pregnant” Frazier having sex with a dog that appears to be a Siberian husky mix about two weeks before she gave birth to a baby, Carter said. It was determined that the video was made in Forrest County, so Carter turned over the information to authorities there.</span></p><p dir=ltr><span>She made her initial appearance in Forrest County Justice Court on Friday morning, where Judge Zach Vaughn set her bond at $20,000. Her bond in Jones County was revoked, meaning she will have to remain in jail until her case here is resolved.</span></p><p dir=ltr><span>But Frazier will still face more charges here because her contact with the canine was a clear violation of one of the conditions of her release from the Jones County Adult Detention Center on $25,000 bond.</span></p><p dir=ltr><span>Jones County Justice Court Judge Grant Hedgepeth ordered Frazier “not be around any animals until this matter is resolved” when she made her initial appearance before him on charges of unnatural intercourse and aggravated animal cruelty. He signed an arrest warrant on her for contempt of court, so a hold has been placed on her to be returned to Jones County if she makes bond on the Forrest County charges.</span></p><p dir=ltr><span>When Frazier was first charged in Jones County, the case received national and international attention. One of the videos showed her committing a sex act with a German shepherd in a church parking lot. She told investigators that was her “service dog,” but it and two other dogs were seized from a residence where she was staying on Norton Road in the Myrick Community.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span>At the time, she told a reporter that she was “forced to do it,” but investigators didn’t find any information to support that claim. A short time after she was released from jail, Frazier posted a short video on social media, unapologetically saying that she had always had sex with dogs and enjoyed it. In a later post, she announced that she was pregnant and included the ultrasound image with a message noting that it was a human baby.</span></p><p dir=ltr><span>“She’s had time to get some help, but obviously, she didn’t,” Carter said.</span></p><p dir=ltr><span>In the course of the investigation, Carter said he’s discovered that there are some who identify as dogs “trans-canines,” and insist that dogs can give consent for sexual contact.</span></p><p dir=ltr><span>A conviction for unnatural intercourse carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcL%2FInKJmqKWlvbp5wK1koqxdlrSitc1omKusmZi5pqvCcWecmmZlhW6wl2lvZmlhmrJurZWabGZrY2yBdIPCm5hwbZNjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
