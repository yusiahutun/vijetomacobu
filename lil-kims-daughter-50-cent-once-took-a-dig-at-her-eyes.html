The cute little bundle of joy often makes headlines because of her eye condition.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2022, 50 Cent took a dig at Royal’s eye defect while trolling her mother. It all started when Lil Kim was featured on the remix of Megan Thee Stallion’s “Plan B.”&nbsp;</p><p>Lil’ Kim’s lyrics in the song seemed directed at her old rival, Nicki Minaj, and had people rising to her defense. Among them was 50 Cent, who tagged Nicki, urging her to “light” Lil Kim up.&nbsp;</p><p>He also joked about how the mom talked about Nicki’s child when her daughter has “f***ked up” eyes. Lil Kim did not take kindly to the since-deleted words. She shared a statement that clarified her lyrics while asking nobody to come for her child.</p><p>Read on for more about Royal Reign Jones Neil, Lil Kim’s daughter, and her eye defect.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Lil-Kim-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Does_Lil_Kim_Have_a_Daughter_With></span>Who Does Lil Kim Have a Daughter With?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lil Kim’s daughter entered this world on June 9, 2014. Royal is a product of Lil Kim’s relationship with Mr. Papers. His real name is Jeremy Neil.</p><p>Royal is the only child the pair share, and neither has any other children from prior or later relationships. While Papers stays low-key as Royal’s father, he has shown he also has her best interests at heart.&nbsp;</p><p>When 50 Cent attacked Royal for her eye condition, Mr. Papers was also upset by his statement. He posted a story tagging the famous rapper and wrote: “@50Cent keep my daughter out of ya Internet comedy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lilkimdau-fotor-20230901145329.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Lil_Kims_child></span>Who Is Lil Kim’s child?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lil Kim has only welcomed one child so far. Her name is Royal Reign Jones Neil, and she has congenital Ptosis.&nbsp;</p><p>She celebrated her 9th birthday in June, and to mark the special day, Lil’ Kim took to Instagram with a montage of posts that included a glimpse of Royal’s 8th birthday party last year.</p><p>The rapper explained in her caption that she shared last year’s party photos because she “didn’t have time” to plan the same caliber of celebration this year.</p><p>She <a href=#>wrote</a>: “This year, I’ve been traveling so much that I didn’t have time to plan my baby’s annual extravagant Royal party. So today, we shut down @ipic with a private screening of The Little Mermaid @hallebailey cause it’s a Royal Reign Mermaid kind of Day! Thank U to everyone at @ipic! U guys really took great care of us, and we appreciate it so much!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Condition_Does_Lil_Kims_Daughter_Have></span>What Condition Does Lil Kim’s Daughter Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lil Kim’s daughter, Royal Reign Jones Neil, has an eye condition called congenital Ptosis. Ptosis is a condition where the victim has droopy eyelid/eyelids. This may or may not be present at the time of birth. However, if the droopy eyelid occurs at birth or within its first year, it is termed congenital Ptosis.</p><p>It is a very noticeable condition. However, the person with the disorder will have no problem with vision. It is usually not heritable, but dominant inheritance is possible.</p><p>Congenital Ptosis can be caused by several things, including genetic defects, chromosomal defects, or damaged nerves weakening the muscles. It is benign but can cover a child’s visual axis and affect vision development if severe.</p><p>Fortunately, Royal’s condition is milder, so her vision remains unharmed, and she can enjoy life as a normal child. Her mother is her greatest friend and supporter and never publicly discusses her condition.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lilkim.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Old_Was_Lil_Kim_When_She_Had_Her_Daughter></span>How Old Was Lil Kim When She Had Her Daughter?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The famous rapper was reportedly 39 years old when she welcomed her daughter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Can_Lil_Kims_Daughters_Eye_Be_Fixed></span>Can Lil Kim’s Daughter’s Eye Be Fixed?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, Royal’s eye can be easily treated. It is best to repair the eyelid drop before the child ages three, but <a href=#>Royal Reign Jones Neil</a> is well past that age. Surgery will be required, but according to various sources, she might not need the treatment.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuaq4jKSgpqtdma62s8etnKtlZWV6pLHNrWSoppOaerW7zqRkmmWUnrRurdNmn56qXZrGpr%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
