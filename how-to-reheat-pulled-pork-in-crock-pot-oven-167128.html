Any meat-lover will tell you that when you reheat pulled pork the next day, it has a tendency to dry out — so the process you choose to reheat smoked pulled pork is critical.&nbsp;</p><p>But the good news is, you don’t have to worry about ruining your leftovers! That’s right — with a little help from our expert chefs, we’re going to help you serve up a tasty meal in no time. Let’s get started by going over three different methods you can use that will help you <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">reheat</a> pulled pork and keep it moist.&nbsp;</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-to-reheat-pulled-pork-in-a-crock-pot>How to Reheat Pulled Pork in a Crock Pot</h2><p>The crock pot or slow cooker is a beloved favorite of many people who like to cook. And how could it not be? Not only does this easy-to-use kitchen appliance allow you to whip up a meal from scratch, but it’s also an ideal way to slow <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">cook your meat</a>, especially if you want to reheat smoked pulled pork.&nbsp;</p><p>With that said, make sure you plan ahead and leave enough time to let the pulled pork reheat most of the afternoon. The amount of time it takes to reheat pulled pork varies. But generally speaking, you will want to allow two to four hours for the meat to heat all the way through. “This process takes a bit longer than other methods, but it’s definitely the better process for a thoroughly heated, tasty pulled pork,” says Claudia Sidoti, a chef at <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">HelloFresh</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that you know <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">how long to reheat</a> pulled pork in a crock pot, it’s time to mention one more important tip: Make sure to save the pan drippings after you cook your pork. Trust us: This juice will come in handy, especially if you want to reheat pulled pork and keep it moist. Here, Sidoti shares her six steps for reheating pulled pork in the crock pot.&nbsp;</p><li>Place the pulled pork in the crock pot.&nbsp;</li><li>Pour the leftover sauce on top of the pulled pork.&nbsp;</li><li>Turn your crock pot on and set it to warm.</li><li>Reheat for about two to four hours.&nbsp;</li><li>Check the temperature before serving. The temperature of the meat should reach 165 degrees Fahrenheit before serving.&nbsp;</li><li>Remove the pulled pork from the crock pot and serve.&nbsp;</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-to-reheat-pulled-pork-in-the-oven>How to Reheat Pulled Pork in the Oven</h2><p>It comes as no surprise that the oven is a top pick for reheating pulled pork. In fact, chef Lazarus Lynch, host of Food Network’s <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Comfort Nation</a> and <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Chopped U</a>, &nbsp;says this is his favorite method of reheating because it ensures thorough distribution of heat, and you can set a timer and forget about it. Sidoti also prefers this method and likes using the oven for large batches of meat. To reheat BBQ pulled pork (or any other type of pulled pork), Lynch says to give these five steps a try, and you will be enjoying a pulled pork sandwich in no time.</p><li>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit.</li><li>Place the pulled pork into a baking dish with leftover juices and cover with a lid.</li><li>Bake until the pulled pork reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit (when using a meat thermometer).&nbsp;</li><li>Mix the pulled pork again.</li><li>Use more sauce or liquid for additional moisture and serve. &nbsp;</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-to-reheat-pulled-pork-in-the-microwave>How to Reheat Pulled Pork in the Microwave</h2><p>Love it or hate it, the microwave is easy-to-use. Plus, it’s pretty darn convenient. But if reheating meat this way makes you cringe, you’re not alone. “This is my least favorite method, but it does work,” says Lynch. So, if you’re looking for a way to <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">reheat</a> frozen pulled pork, the microwave will work. That said, make sure to thaw the meat in the refrigerator before attempting to reheat BBQ pulled pork. This will require some pre-planning on your part, since the process can take anywhere from six to eight hours.</p><p>Once your pulled pork is ready to pop in the microwave, Sidoti recommends following these five simple steps.</p><li>Place the pulled pork in a microwave-safe dish.</li><li>Add juice, such as apple juice. This helps reheat pulled pork and keep it moist.&nbsp;</li><li>Insert the pulled pork into the microwave.</li><li>Heat the pulled pork on high for two minutes, or until you get an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit with a meat thermometer.&nbsp;</li><li>Serve.</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-to-reheat-pulled-pork-on-the-stove>How to Reheat Pulled Pork on the Stove</h2><p>If you have a Dutch oven taking up space in your kitchen, you might want to consider using this method to reheat pulled pork the next day. But what exactly is a Dutch oven? Don’t worry; it sounds a lot fancier than what it actually is. In simple terms, a Dutch oven is a large heavy <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">cooking</a> pot with a tight-fitting lid. You can use them to keep <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">food</a> warm, especially if it’s over a long period of time (kind of like a crock pot). And the best part? A Dutch oven has the reputation of producing moist and tasty pulled pork. If you’re ready to try out this method, Lynch says to follow these five steps when reheating pulled pork on the stove.</p><li>Place the pulled pork into a Dutch oven.</li><li>Add any leftover juices on top of the pulled pork and cover with a lid.</li><li>Heat a skillet over medium heat.</li><li>Allow the pulled pork to warm up gradually, occasionally stirring, until the pulled pork reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit when using a meat thermometer.&nbsp;</li><li>Use more sauce or liquid for additional moisture.&nbsp;</li><p>While we’re on the topic of adding moisture with extra sauce, here are a few tips from Lynch to help juice up your pulled pork.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Save the pan drippings for a moist and succulent reheat.</li><li>If you don’t have leftover pan juices, use barbecue sauce in combination with apple juice, a can of dark soda (such as Coke), beer, or a low-sodium stock/broth.&nbsp;</li><li>Serving suggestion: ½ cup liquid to 1 cup pulled pork.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Now that you have four different <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">ways to reheat</a> pulled pork, it’s time to get busy whipping up some leftovers. If you need a few meal ideas, why not serve up some juicy pulled pork sandwiches with a side of <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">French fries</a>, <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">corn on the cob</a>, or <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">sweet potatoes</a>. All three of those side-dishes reheat nicely and only take a few minutes.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=more-from-first>More From FIRST</h2><p><a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Weekend Project: Make Homemade Wine in Your Instant Pot</a></p><p><a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">70 Drool-Worthy Ground Beef Recipes That Will Make You Forget Tacos Exist</a></p><p><a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">How Eating More Carbs Can Actually Help You Lose More Weight</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonainlGK%2Fpq%2FIqZysZ5ikxG7AzmapnqCVlsFuvNSlo56cXaW8s7eMoqVmm6KksKx5z6irZqemmrtufZVwaGtw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
