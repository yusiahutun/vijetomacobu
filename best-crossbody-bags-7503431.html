For everybody that falls into the ladder category, welcome to our roundup of best crossbody bags. And we say “best” from our chests, because we can <strong>personally recommend the ones we’ve had hands-on experiences with</strong>. Some of these bags have been <strong>with our editors for years</strong>, coming with gushing reviews about their favorite crossbody bags. Others we <strong>evaluated in our lab</strong>, putting them through <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>rigorous tests</a> like splashing water on them or dropping them on the ground. In total, <strong>43 crossbody bags were reviewed</strong> and then cut down to the following list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With so much glitz and glam beckoning for your wallet’s attention, it can be difficult to decide where to best allocate your coins. New York City-based stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Jamie Grimstad </a>shares her two cents, stating that “splurging in the accessory category makes the most sense as you can<strong> justify the cost-per-wear more</strong>.” A bag that can be styled across multiple outfits deserves a little more consideration when purchasing. Whether you decide to ball out today or be a little more conservative is up to you, but we hope our favorite bags resonate with you as you read.&nbsp;</p><span id=mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block">Our Testing by the Numbers</span><ul><li><strong>Bags Tested: </strong>43</li><li><strong>Testing Period: </strong>Two weeks to three years, depending on the product</li><li><strong>Type of Testing: </strong>Real world, lab testing</li><li><strong>Factors Considered: </strong>Water resistance, capacity, portability, ease of use, durability, value, additional features (pockets, adjustable strap, etc.)</li><li><strong>Experts Interviewed: </strong>4</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-baggu-medium-nylon-crescent-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Baggu Nylon Crescent Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Baggu Medium Nylon Crescent Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/SN5wOKplDnth9ExvOEonTmJ6CXg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/baggu-medium-crossbody-crescent-bag-8d66939306df429aaeee4dc1cdd3ff5f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>BAGGU</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It can fit a bunch of essentials without weighing down on the shoulder.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not very waterproof.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If we had to guess what bag Mary Poppins always carried around, we would say it’s this one from Baggu. It’s as though it <strong>magically expands internally</strong> with how much it can hold. We were able to fit books (yes plural), full-sized water bottles, sunglasses, cameras, phones, and wallets simultaneously in this miracle bag. With all of these goods inside, we worried our shoulders would get sore when carrying it around, but the aching never occurred. Although we appreciate the neutral tones like black and navy, the more<strong> colorful options and fun prints </strong>make this piece stand out from the rest. It’s truly a carry-all bag for everyday life and we can wholeheartedly say we would pay even more than the $50 for such a<strong> quality piece.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Nylon | <strong>Size: </strong>13.75 (W) x<strong> </strong>8 (H) x 4 (D) inches | <strong>Colors: </strong>13<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-athleta-all-about-crossbody-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Athleta All About Crossbody</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Athleta All About Crossbody Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/On-6E68Fjlu_k6VhpXy6H3ZzDv0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/athleta-all-about-crossbody-f231a1709e89490ba67fff244524bd62.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Athleta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It has a water-repellent finish to it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It has no compartments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’ve tested and adored Athleta’s belt bag before, so it only made sense to try a crossbody bag as well. We’ve used this sling while running errands and walking around town and experienced firsthand <strong>how durable and comfortable it is</strong>. The <strong>strap doesn’t dig</strong> into the shoulder and gives <strong>great access to the contents</strong> inside the bag. A bag, which despite its lack of compartments, has tons of space to carry all our essentials. The exterior is also <strong>water-repellent and lightweight, </strong>making it easy to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>travel</a> with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>69% Polyester/31% Recycled Polyester<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>12.25 (W) x<strong> </strong>7.5 (H) x 4 (D) inches<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-seth-milot-day-vi-gris></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Seth Milot Day VI Gris</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Seth Milot Day VI Gris" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/04OyYk5c-0pZeZnjZYbwJPmDJ1E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Seth-Milot-Day-VI-Gris-b139f5cdee174713baaeb7278fddd64b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Seth Milot</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The bag looks and feels elegant.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There are no interior pockets or dividers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Budding handbag brand Seth Milot offers a line of sculptural handbags worth their salt in the luxury market. While <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bianca Kratky</a>, co-author of this article, was taken aback by the beauty of all of the bags when she viewed the collection, it’s this Day VI bag that most stood out to her for its <strong>practicality and fine stitch work.</strong> The <strong>nappa leather</strong> felt as <strong>soft as butter</strong>, and the interior featured an Hermès-like <strong>suede orange lining,</strong> which happens to be her favorite color. The <strong>strap is adjustable</strong> in length and the closure features a twist clasp that adds a level of security to the piece.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Napa leather<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>19 (W) x<strong> </strong>14 (H) x 8.25 (D) inches<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-patterned-clare-v-midi-sac></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Patterned</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Clare V.

The Midi Sac comes in<strong> various colors, patterns, and designs</strong>, catering to a number of aesthetics. Beyond just its visual appeal, we found the crossbody bag to be an <strong>excellent travel companion</strong>. It fits a bunch of essentials and zips closed all the way so that nothing can fall out. Although it does come with a simple strap, you can add on different styled straps, from thick to thin to woven to chain, although it will cost extra.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather | <strong>Size: </strong>17.5 (W) x<strong> </strong>5.5 (H) x 2.5 (D) inches<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>20</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-organization-baggallini-everywhere-bagg-with-rfid></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Organization</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Baggallini Everywhere Bagg</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Baggallini Everywhere Bagg with RFID" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tBWTLzSn9F3gabsi--HdQm5dZ5k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/baggallini-everywhere-bagg-with-rfid-1bcc82e3fb3a4176b11a3475de763664.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There is a compartment for absolutely everything, allowing us to organize as we please.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not the most fashion-forward bag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The category is compartments and Baggallini takes the crown. It’s because of the <strong>many pockets, side zips, and dividers </strong>that this bag became our go-to choice for both work and travel. We take it everywhere we go and we <strong>never lose any items</strong> in it with its excellent organization capabilities. On top of the four main pockets on the exterior of the bag, the interior features a<strong> zippered compartment </strong>and a few slots to<strong> hold pens and little notepads</strong>. And while we love using the long crossbody strap, on occasion we would shorten it to <strong>use as a shoulder bag</strong>. When we wanted to go completely hands-free, however, the little slit on the back allowed us to slip it over the handles of a suitcase.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Nylon | <strong>Size: </strong>11 (W) x<strong> </strong>9 (H) x 5 (D) inches<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>10</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-camera-bag-madewell-the-large-transport-camera-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Camera Bag</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell Large Transport Camera Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell The Large Transport Camera Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/E-MfpQlMwEVpA1PwmQB5KFSkrjg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/madewell-the-large-transport-camera-bag-4310698fad1449bdbd0dec88f8e76c01.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Madewell</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Even with a DSLR camera in the bag, there was enough space for wallets, keys, and other essentials.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s only offered in one size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our biggest pet peeve with camera bags is that they tend to look clunky and unstylish, and they leave no space for anything else. Not this Madewell Transport Bag, however. We were able to<strong> fit our DSLR camera</strong> along with our sunglasses, a small wallet, keys, and chapstick for a fun adventure exploring a new city. It allowed us to <strong>look stylish while traveling</strong> and not like an obvious tourist. The thicker<strong> strap also felt extremely comfortable</strong> on our shoulders even after a long day of wear — a huge win for anyone familiar with the quarrels of schlepping heavy camera gear around. The<strong> top closes completely, </strong>making it safe for cameras as well. After experiencing its style, functionality, and comfort, we think this bag is well worth the price it comes with.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>9.5 (W) x<strong> </strong>6.5 (H) x 3.25 (D) inches | <strong>Colors: </strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-clutch-radley-london-sundown-avenue-weave-medium-flapover-clutch></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Clutch</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Radley London Sundown Avenue Weave Medium Flapover Clutch</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Radley London Sundown Avenue Weave Medium Flapover Clutch" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/TwTx3evUq2jsn19ibxZIh1aLUmk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Radley-London-Sundown-Avenue-Weave-Medium-Flapover-Clutch-ea12be7ddbc842d4907291f35088c611.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Radley London</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The chain strap can be removed and the bag used as a clutch.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not extremely spacious.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This bag<strong> doubles as a clutch </strong>and a crossbody bag by either unclipping the chain strap or simply dropping it into the pouch. We’ve used this from day to night, from brunch to a formal event simply by adjusting how we used the strap. Although it wasn’t the most spacious of bags, it did <strong>hold all our daily essentials</strong> like wallets, keys, phones, and chapsticks. Because it’s so <strong>lightweight</strong>, it’s been our go-to travel bag as well. It takes up little to no space (and weight) when packing. The fully leather weave design makes it<strong> look elevated,</strong> adding a touch of elegance to our outfits whenever we put it on. Overall, it’s been a fantastic bag to have in our rotation.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather, metal<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>11 (W) x<strong> </strong>&nbsp;5.5 (H) x 3.5 (D) inches | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-leather-portland-leather-large-circle-crossbody></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Leather</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Portland Leather Large Circle Crossbody</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Portland Leather Large Circle Crossbody" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/wA2vWSpGchKpokl0QNf0CqglyRU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Portland-Leather-Large-Circle-Crossbody-69a5efa000174d6cb7050da84f11351b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Portland Leather</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The leather weathers great against any distressors.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not the best shape to hold a chunky camera.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This bag has been our everyday purse, travel buddy, and road trip essential for the last two years. It’s a <strong>decent size with manageable weight</strong>, and the <strong>leather strap is thick </strong>enough to distribute the weight of the bag evenly so that it never digs or feels uncomfortable. It also has seven holes in a belt-like style so you can <strong>adjust the length </strong>to match your height. The leather impressed us with how <strong>durable</strong> it has been — we’ve spilled liquids and collected scratches over the years but it <strong>never stained or looked beat-up</strong>. Although we visually love the circular bag, it may not be the most economical option for anyone traveling with a chunky camera.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>9 (W) x<strong> </strong>9 (H) x 3 (D) inches | <strong>Colors: </strong>16<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-designer-bottega-veneta-mini-loop-camera-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Designer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bottega Veneta Loop Camera Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bottega Veneta Mini Loop Camera Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2sbf90M26nRANsuMJXgrMHCEWJY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bottega-veneta-small-loop-camera-bag-23510c2bec3840e7a7c25f13c1a81485.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bottega Veneta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The lambskin leather is extra soft and supple.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The strap is thin and may not be the most comfortable option.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Choosing an investment piece requires a keen eye. If the ever-popular designer label isn’t enough to convince you, then consider the following factors: The lambskin leather that Bottega Veneta uses is truly next level — Kratky owns one of the bags in a similar style and finds the leather to be superior to many of the other famous designer brands. And, the woven design is not only an eye-catching feature but helps to conceal any scratches that are bound to occur with wear over time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even Grimstad deems this bag <strong>the perfect investment</strong>. “It comes in a neutral color, ensuring you get to wear it over and over again. The size also gives it styling versatility, be it over a coat in the winter or with athleisure to run errands.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Lambskin leather<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>8.7 (W) x<strong> </strong>6.1 (H) x 3.5 (D) inches | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-work-bellroy-tokyo-work-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Work</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bellroy Tokyo Work Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bellroy Tokyo Work Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MzAXeAjJlGzQHJArUkHM5Ekjelk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Bellroy-Tokyo-Work-Bag-19931f2309a64ff3821cb4173c92285c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Backcountry</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The sole is cushioned and it protects the contents from breaking.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not the most aesthetic bag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Much like the Baggallini option, this bag from Bellroy is <strong>full of compartments and organization capabilities</strong>, making it an excellent choice for work. The main compartment includes a <strong>laptop pocket</strong>, another thinner pocket layered over the laptop pocket, two stretchy compartments for notebooks and tablets, and a mini zippered mesh pocket for keys. It doesn’t stop there — the outer shell has two zippered pockets and a large snap-closure pocket on the side. There’s even a <strong>water bottle slip </strong>as well.

We also found the shoulder<strong> strap to be thickly padded </strong>— an important comfort factor. If we wanted to, however, we could switch to carrying it by the handles. Last but not least, we tested its <strong>waterproof</strong> claims and can confirm that water simply beaded on the bag’s surface, never soiling a single document in the interior.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Recycled polyester<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>17.3 (W) x<strong> </strong>14.2 (H) x 6.3 (D) inches | <strong>Colors:</strong>&nbsp;3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-travel-dagne-dover-micah-crossbody></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Travel</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dagne Dover Micah Crossbody</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dagne Dover Micah Crossbody" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8g86R-ZTtFM4T1OUFsBU2KEFPtc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dagne-dover-micah-crossbody-18f90ef41f294a69ae0c5a33241fdc81.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dagne Dover</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It fits a ton of items without looking bulky or large.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It stains easily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s no denying that we’re big fans of Dagne Dover.

One of its winning points was its size — we were able to fit everything we could need in a day, including snacks, cameras, wallets, little notebooks, and hand creams <strong>without looking bulky</strong>. It’s sneakily larger on the inside than it appears. Dagne Dover’s signature <strong>neoprene material </strong>was something to adore as well.

In cases like these, consider this nappa leather bag from Ruskin, handmade in Italy. The label marries expert craftsmanship with <strong>a sleek silhouette</strong> for a unique yet versatile bag that oozes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>quiet luxury</a>. Although there are <strong>no zippers</strong> to keep your valuables safe, we have confidence in the magnetic flap. We haven’t tested this option to be sure, but if we did, we’d bring it to a work dinner and an impending trip to Italy all the same.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Full grain leather<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>10.5 (W) x<strong> </strong>8.5 (H) x 4 (D) inches | <strong>Colors: </strong>5<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-pouch-behno-frida-mini-crossbody-pebble-ruched-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Pouch</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Behno Frida Mini Crossbody Pebble Ruched Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Behno Frida Mini Crossbody Pebble Ruched Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/oEKNB0BZW-oH_KBpFYw9tmN6jH4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Behno-Frida-Mini-Crossbody-Pebble-Ruched-Bag-4ea9275f70d746cab6dfdaf15cd44bd2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Behno</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The textured leather will keep the bag from showing scratches easily.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The strap is not adjustable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Generally, we love Behno, a relatively new bag brand on the scene, for its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">sustainable business model</a>. While we didn’t test this option, the simply elegant <strong>pebbled leather bag</strong> with a <strong>drawstring closure </strong>is really appealing to us. There are<strong> two interior compartments,</strong> which leaves room for some organization capabilities, but mostly the pouch is there for you to drop your essentials in (think phone, wallet, granola bar, keys, etc) and travel simply (both in terms of function and style).

Not to mention, this style of bag tends to be deeper and therefore fits more items than your standard purse. It can be<strong> held by the top handle </strong>or draped across the body with the long strap — which by the way, is <strong>removable but not adjustable</strong> in length. The <strong>soft suede interior </strong>will be excellent for keeping valuable scratch-free, on top of delivering a luxurious feel.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>6.7 (W) x<strong> </strong>7.5 (H) x 4.7 (D) inches | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-clear-hammitt-tony-sml-stadium-approved-clear-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Clear</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hammitt Stadium-Approved Clear Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hammitt Tony SML Stadium-approved Clear Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FtpBe7LDEhC99lKm8XUwCB53Z5g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hammitt-tony-sml-stadium-approved-clear-bag-d3647faecac54f2aa76a4b44e497fe79.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>A leather strap makes it comfortable to carry on the shoulder.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish it was a tiny bit larger.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Clear bags are truly a unique look, and while it may not be the best option for walking around Paris — a city notoriously known for pickpockets — we found it to be <strong>ideal for the beach</strong>, concerts, and festivals. Although it looks seemingly small, we were able to<strong> fit our Kindle inside,</strong> along with our phones, AirPods, wallets, and lip glosses. The bag has a <strong>soft leather strap</strong>, which we much preferred over something plastic, as it could have tugged and pulled at our skin.

It comes with<strong> two types of straps</strong> that you can swap in and out — in other words, you can’t keep both straps on simultaneously. With <strong>gold finish hardware</strong>, a microfiber leather lining, a <strong>luxuriously soft shearling</strong>, and a calf leather exterior the bag is just so trendy and cool. The crescent moon shape almost hugs and curves around the body when worn as a crossbody, further adding to its comfort factor. Although it wasn’t one of our tested options, it’s so different from anything else on the market that we didn’t want you to miss it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Calf leather, leather, shearling<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>10.43 (W) x<strong> </strong>9.06 (H) x 3.94 (D) inches | <strong>Colors: </strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-small-tumi-persia-crossbody></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Small</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tumi Persia Crossbody</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tumi Persia Crossbody" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YfWfTYFa24UIMSkYdOrUj30d-ak=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tumi-persia-crossbody-8e96620a85c945ad8d756d557012862f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Tumi</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It sits flush against the body.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The strap is not removable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This has been our <strong>go-to bag when traveling</strong> because it’s small enough that we can sometimes <strong>sneak it under a coat </strong>as another personal item.

The <strong>large size of the bag</strong> makes it easy to stuff it with loose items that our kids accumulate through the day, while still <strong>fitting a full-sized wallet</strong> and all our other parental essentials. Thanks to the <strong>mesh back panel,</strong> the bag feels very breathable and doesn’t get hot and sticky even on warmer days. On the inside, there is a small mesh pocket where we typically keep our keys or chapsticks.

If excessive amounts of features and pockets only feel overwhelming, you’re going to love the<strong> large center compartment </strong>on this bag.

To begin, there were<strong> tons of pockets</strong> in and around this bag that made organization really easy, while <strong>leaving enough space in the center </strong>compartment. Our favorite pocket was the <strong>padded laptop sleeve </strong>that aptly protected our computer even after dropping the bag on the floor.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The canvas material also did a decent job of <strong>resisting water infiltration</strong> after spritzing it.

Fashion stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Heather Newberger</a> says “I prefer to keep my bag roughly the size of a piece of paper (or a little bigger) so I can neatly tuck my iPad into one while I’m on the go.” If you’re hoping to travel with your bag, then something slightly bigger that fits snacks, passports, and a Kindle is a better choice. If you simply want a fashionable piece that holds all your essentials, something slightly smaller, ranging in the six to eight-inch width to height is a great option.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Organization</strong>: With compact sizes, pockets make all the difference in how much you can squeeze into your crossbody bag. Plus, celebrity stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Samantha Brown</a> says easy access is key — so in addition to interior pockets, look for crossbody bags with front or back ones too, preferably ones that clasp or zip. Brown likes to “keep my smaller items, like lip gloss and AirPods, in the tiny inside pocket, use the main pocket for bigger things such as my wallet, a book, or tablet, and keep a top pocket flexible for things I need to store ASAP like packing slips and receipts.”&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Material</strong>: If you are considering a sporty, sling style that’ll need to brave all kinds of elements, Newberger suggests finding one with flexible material, like nylon. “A crossbody sling will often function as an extension of an overall outfit, so you want to be thoughtful about how long you may be wearing it, " she says. If you’re less worried about wear and tear, then leather is a fantastic choice. Not just for its luxurious appearance, but for its durability and longevity as well. Ruskin founder <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Alli Abdelal</a> considers leather to be “a by-product from nature” that maintains many of its intrinsic characteristics well. These features include softness, fine grain, durability, and resistance to rain.

Slings are often considered crossbody bags, too; however, traditional crossbody bags typically allow the pouch to rest on the back, keeping your hands, hips, and front body completely free.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most crossbody bags have adjustable straps, so you can choose to wear them at whatever length feels most comfortable to you.
