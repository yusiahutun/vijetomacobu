harassed her in a rambling tweet, that he had 'slapped her vagina.'<br></span></p><p><span>Police have dismissed Amanda's claims that she was 'touched inappropriately' during her arrest on drug charges last week.<br></span></p><p><span>'Internal Affairs investigators have found no evidence to corroborate Ms. Bynes' allegations,' the NYPD said in a statement.<br></span></p><p><span>'To the

variety of posts, claiming she needs another nose job and wearing a number of different colored wigs.</span></p><img

have her nose fixed, saying: 'I have no bandage on. It's healing on it's own like my doctor asked.</span></p><p><span>'I'm getting one more in 3 weeks, they are short amazing surgeries done while I'm awake but under general anesthesia. It's almost perfect.'</span></p><p><span>She also took to Twitter to say: 'My dad is as ugly as RuPaul! So thankful I look nothing like you both! I had nose surgery after my mug shots so my nose and I are gorgeous!'</span></p><p><span>The drag queen was not too amused, and fired back with, 'Derogatory slurs are ALWAYS an outward projection of a person's own poisonous self-loathing @AmandaBynes.'<br></span></p><p><span>Her attorney, Richard A Hutton, last week said the former actress seemed 'fine' in every interaction he has ever had with her, even in recent phone conversations since her arrest.<br></span></p><p><span>Hutton, who is representing the 27-year-old teen star for a string of motor vehicle incidents since April 2012 of last year, told People magazine he believes the whole case has been 'blown out of proportion.'<br></span></p><p><span>Hutton went on to explain: 'The New York case doesn't seem like much of a case, really. I mean, come on.<br></span></p><p><span>'Even if you believe everything you hear, it's something that amounts to virtually nothing.<br></span></p><p><span>'And it's my understanding there's not much evidence to back that case up.<br></span></p><p><span>'There's no physical evidence to back it up.

Every time I've talked to her, I've had nice, attorney-client normal relations with her.'<br></span></p><p><span>Hutton is not Bynes's attorney in the state of New York and is only representing her for a number of different charges she has accumulated since last year.<br></span></p><p><span>The next hearing for her DUI case is set for July 18.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmlsa2Rsf3p7oKaYp5yRYo%2B6usSsZJ6umZjBprCMh5ywZYmkv6x5wKmYq6ydmru1ecOasKxllKfCqHnAq6meq6RjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
