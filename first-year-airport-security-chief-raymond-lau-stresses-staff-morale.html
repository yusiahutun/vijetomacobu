"I have been introducing a lot of changes that they could not enjoy in the past."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lau now faces the challenge of building a workforce ready for a future in which passenger numbers are expected to grow to 100 million by 2030 with the proposed addition of a third runway.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lau's six-year plan focuses on creating a clear career path. Select officers are chosen for a two-year management training scheme, education subsidies are available to all staff, and better promotion opportunities are on offer as Lau wants to hire fewer retirees from the disciplined services for managerial roles.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also lifted a ban on mobile phones, allowing staff to use them during meal breaks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"At the start there were some problems and people were abusing it, but it's a positive policy," he said. "Some of the older staff who don't use mobile phones say the policy is excellent because the younger staff really appreciate it."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another area that has been tightened up in light of Chau's arrest is overtime. Assistant executive directors and above cannot now claim overtime, while staff at manager level and above get time off in lieu.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"If I need to claim overtime, I cannot because that is my duty," Lau said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He is overhauling internal policies and working with the Independent Commission Against Corruption to ensure Avseco is seen to be clean.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We needed to improve our corporate governance to bring the confidence back, so we've tightened up the policies and liaised closely with the ICAC," Lau said. "We want to show everybody - the public and the clients - that we are transparent."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And what of Chau, of whom little has been heard since the arrest?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"It was so sudden and even he had no idea why this happened as he was away at a conference and it occurred on the day he returned," Lau said, adding that he had not spoken to his former police colleague since.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"He was supposed to finish in January [next year] as he would be 65, so I had figured we would continue to work together until then," he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Lau monitors terrorism across the world to keep HK airport safe</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The militant Islamic State hints at terror attacks in Asia; Muslim separatists carry out deadly strikes in mainland cities. Every day, it seems, a new terrorist danger appears in the headlines.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But for Raymond Lau Chi-keung, assessing security threats is second nature. His 31-year police career - including six years as assistant commissioner for security - has proved "useful" in his new role as airport security chief. As head of the Aviation Security Company (Avseco), the body set up to keep one of the world's busiest airports safe, Lau says reducing the risk of a terrorist attack is a constant task.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"The police are responsible for the intelligence and the threat assessment, and obviously we have to upgrade the security arrangement [in response]," Lau said. "But apart from waiting for this reactive intelligence coming in, we are quite proactive."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Every day, Avesco staff monitored the latest potential threats from around the world, Lau said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We watch all the news about terrorist attacks and airport incidents worldwide," he said. "If there's anything happening, we will study it and see if this can happen in Hong Kong."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lau learned much from his experiences as police security chief when Hong Kong held the equestrian events for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Days before the events began, terrorist attacks in the restive Xinjiang autonomous region prompted calls to raise the risk assessment in Hong Kong, which was rated moderate at the time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"In fact, I was in the centre of it. I assessed each and every [piece of] intelligence, and I didn't think it would affect us and that's why I didn't raise the level of the threat," Lau recalled. "I remember at the time, the police commissioner said: 'You are responsible'."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lau also headed the police's VIP protect programme.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Airport security chief puts staff first</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZomKusmZi5pnuQbm5uaWVrfKe10ayrZrGVlr9urcirp6iqpGLApq%2FUq6CtsV2YtaqxxWapmrGdpLulecuarGarpKeytL%2FErGSsrJGbs265zquYpZ0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
