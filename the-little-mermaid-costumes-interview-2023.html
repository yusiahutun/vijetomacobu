Gone are the days of damsels in distress waiting for Prince Charming to save them. Heck, Frozen is less about a love plot than it is about learning to love difficult siblings! That’s why so many eyes are on the new live-action adaptation of The Little Mermaid. In the original 1989 animated film—let’s face it—Ariel drastically changes her physical appearance and gives up her literal voice to pursue a man. It isn’t the best message to send our children or anyone else. So what does it mean to be Ariel in 2023?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While there is a love plot in the new adaptation (in theaters everywhere Friday, May 26), the romance plays second fiddle to Ariel’s intellectual curiosity. There’s a reason <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogeb315y2n8" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the film’s first trailer" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the film’s first trailer</a> features King Triton scolding his daughter for breaking the rules and visiting humans in “the above world”—and Ariel responding, “I just want to know more about them.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s also partially why the animated film’s seashell bras are not seen in this adaptation. The film’s costumes were brought to life by prolific designer Colleen Atwood, whose numerous credits include Netflix’s recent hit <a href=# title=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a42027353/wednesday-netflix-costume-design-interview/ data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a42027353/wednesday-netflix-costume-design-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Wednesday class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Wednesday</a>, Sleepy Hollow (1999), Into the Woods (2014), and the forthcoming Beetlejuice 2 (2024), which began shooting in London this month. We caught up with Atwood to discuss not just the infamous shells—or lack thereof—but also all of the costuming decisions she made to help us feel like part of Ariel’s world, as well as how she makes this fantastical teenage mermaid feel like part of ours.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>For a film like The Little Mermaid—which is so fantastical, so rooted in our world in one way but very much made-up in another—how do you even begin to research or ideate what the costuming should look like?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The thing is, as with Wednesday, if there is a script, it’s somewhat on the page. [With costuming work], you have to try to reinvent yourself and what you do. You know certain tricks of the trade, but you have to try not to use the same ones over and over again. So it’s about starting with the script and coming up with new ideas, new materials, new science, new art, and [staying] current in that way.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>A lot of this film is CGI. What role did actual, physical costumes play?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s definitely a different process. In my case, I built real costumes to resemble what I wanted it to look like, because it really helped the digital people with color and shapes. Digital always gives you this grid-type look, so it’s good to get off that grid. We gave them good references, and as much real stuff as we could. If you give the CGI people a solid reference, they have a better template to go off than just creating it from scratch digitally.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We took a lot of fish influences for the different merfolk, and had different tails and colorations to represent the seven seas, so it was this world of sea life. Instead of everyone having green tails, each person became a fish inspired by the oceans they came from. These costumes were all hand-painted, and some had shell enhancements, or silk-screens we did that resembled scales.</p><img alt="halle bailey as ariel in disney's live action the little mermaid photo courtesy of disney © 2023 disney enterprises, inc all rights reserved" title="THE LITTLE MERMAID" width=4096 height=1716 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tlm-dt2-stills-request-4k-rec709-20230228-0001-646f6a9b1afdd.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Disney</span></p><img alt="l r jonah hauer king as prince eric and halle bailey as ariel in disney's live action the little mermaid photo courtesy of disney © 2023 disney enterprises, inc all rights reserved" title="THE LITTLE MERMAID" width=4096 height=1716 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tlm-stills-request-04-4k-rec709-20230320-646f6e2998ca2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Disney</span></p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>So you made all of these beautiful costumes and the actors didn’t wear them, or hardly did?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When the actors were working, they were in the usual motion-capture suits 90 percent of the time. There were a few pieces that the actors wore. [King Triton’s] breastplate—he was really wearing that. Melissa McCarthy’s Ursula costume, she wore that most of the time. That was a difficult one. It had to be like a dance costume but still look like Ursula, so we had to figure out where the octopus legs ended and the costume began, and also where the human body fits in that costume. That was a complex process.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>This film has such a unique, distinctive aesthetic universe. Which came first—the set or the costumes?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The costumes and set came up together in preproduction. We started with the merpeople, and after a couple months, we started exploring the above-the-sea world and relating that back to the ocean. A lot of times, set departments start with a longer lead than costuming, but because we had so many digital sets, and movement was involved, I was incorporated in the mix with the crew pretty much from the beginning.</p><img alt="costume designs by colleen atwood for disney's live action the little mermaid photo by giles keyte © 2023 disney enterprises, inc all rights reserved" title="THE LITTLE MERMAID" width=1281 height=1920 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/scp-05081-copy-646f6caade185.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Photo Credit: Giles Keyte</span><p>Ariel’s mermaid ensemble sans CGI</p><img alt="costume designs by colleen atwood for disney's live action the little mermaid photo by giles keyte © 2023 disney enterprises, inc all rights reserved" title="THE LITTLE MERMAID" width=1281 height=1920 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/scp-29441-copy-646f6d89107e9.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Photo Credit : Giles Keyte</span><p>Ariel and Prince Eric’s “above the sea” outfits</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Tell me about the above-the-sea world.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I had a great time costuming the above world as much as the underwater stuff. It was this fantasy 1830s-meets-Caribbean world. I got to do fun dance-number costumes, costumes for the royal court, all those costumes. Then there are the sailors on the ship. You’ll see, it’s not just one approach to costume but worlds within worlds. The merpeople have one look, and the villagers and people who live closer to the ocean, more “of the ocean”—their colors are more of the colors of live coral and vibrant colors of the sea.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Both in the story and in the design, the idea of two worlds that exist separately but have a lot in common was a storyline. I took the organic quality of sea creatures and seashells and corals, and incorporated them into the textures and colors. In the court, it was more about pearls and jewelry. We rented all this vintage jewelry for the court, and [made] a few of these otherworldly pieces. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.4ocean.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=4ocean data-vars-ga-product-id=bd88b911-9103-4e71-b483-965fe9b663a2 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.4ocean.com/ data-product-url=https://www.4ocean.com/ data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-price=$15.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=f73a716b-8a4e-4b28-aa7d-c6935b99108b class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">4ocean</a> does these clear beads out of recycled plastic bottles. I used their beads to make a breastplate for the queen. I’ve always loved those beads because they’re small and clear, so it looks pretty when it’s laid onto something.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>A noticeable absence from this film: Ariel’s shell bra.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We walked away from that one. I just think we wanted to have a more fishlike quality to the girls. Having them all plonk seashells on their breasts seemed like a weird way to go. And when you start putting shells on real bodies, it’s hard to make them look good, believe me. We went with a bralette that still has a fish vibe but wasn’t as aggressive as a shell bra.</p><img alt="l r jonah hauer king as prince eric and halle bailey as ariel in disney's live action the little mermaid photo by giles keyte © 2023 disney enterprises, inc all rights reserved" title="THE LITTLE MERMAID" width=1920 height=1281 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/scp-14940-646f6b31386bd.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Photo Credit: Giles Keyte</span></p><img alt="l r halle bailey as ariel and jonah hauer king as prince eric in disney's live action the little mermaid photo by giles keyte © 2023 disney enterprises, inc all rights reserved" title="THE LITTLE MERMAID" width=1920 height=1281 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/scp-06004-646f6e8ddf4ad.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Photo Credit: Giles Keyte</span></p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What was the most challenging part of costuming this film?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We shot it over a very long period of time, because we shut down the day we were supposed to start shooting [because of the pandemic]. You get up and running—then boom, it’s gone. But the costumes were done; they did not change when we eventually resumed production. I had to finish some multiples, but the show was pretty much ready to go. All the worlds were designed.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Was it difficult to walk away from a production and then to have to come back?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At first it was so mind-boggling on so many levels. I couldn’t stop thinking about it the whole time. I was figuring out different things for Ariel’s sisters. In my mind, I still worked on everything because I kept it alive in my brain instead of totally walking away.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>I love to ask costume designers this: Did your actors try to pilfer anything from the costume department?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I’m sure they did, but I didn’t clock anything serious. Everybody always wants a memento, right? I didn’t see things go bye-bye, but I’m sure everybody got a little something. I had so many costumes and so many multiples, but even with the volume of costumes, it all got worn so much. Everything was pretty much in use and under control. When you have stuff that doesn’t get used, that’s when it tends to float away.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Todd Plummer is a Boston based journalist covering culture and lifestyle.
