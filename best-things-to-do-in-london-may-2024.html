As soon as I stepped into the dimly lit, buzzy restaurant reminiscent of the 1930’s Tokyo kissas and Shanghai’s drinking dens, I knew this was going to be a high contender for the most elevated brunch experience I've had in London.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Expect to start with an omakase sushi selection, which is exceptionally presented and deliciously light. If you're an adventurous foodie, the brunch is then followed<strong>&nbsp;</strong>by<strong>&nbsp;</strong>beetroot and umeboshi and tomato and strawberry with tofu cream canapes. The unique flavours were vibrant and light, though admittedly not my favourite.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>The brunch truly shines on the third course, where moreish ‘GFC’ fried chicken, bao buns and mushroom tempura promise divine flavours. If you're not already full, two more courses follow, of which we shared the succulent baby chicken teriyaki asian chimichurri and light tom kha pumpkin glass noodles.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>It wasn't until the dessert arrived that I was truly blown away - it almost looked like art. The 'Lucky' matcha and raspberry iced lollipops were a true highlight.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Available Saturdays between 11am and 4pm for £95 per person.

With their eponymous offering, Galvin at Windows perched amidst the top floor of the Park Lane Hilton, it’s a restaurant I truly treasure for imparting some wonderful culinary memories.&nbsp;</p><p>I had high expectations of dining at another Galvin locale, La Chapelle. Sitting resplendent amid the suited city workers and revellers of Bishopsgate and once a grade two listed former school, its imposing nature is quickly banished as you enter. The high exposed beams of the illustrious ceiling ensure the cacophony of happy dinners bounce from every wall enveloping you in a heady atmosphere.&nbsp;</p><p>Dining at La Chapelle will whisk you away to heavenly vistas. The tasting menu with wine pairings gleefully brought to us by our wonderful sommelier Francesco was truly a joyful adventure. The Foie gras and ham hock semifreddo was the highlight, the beautifully decorated green sphere of godly goodness parting easily under the gentle push of a fork to reveal the sumptuous pink flakes lurking inside. Also of note was a perfect cylinder of Cornish cod doused in a dashi ‘beurre blanc’. There were perfect mouthfuls on every bite and I wish I had ordered bread to mop up the buttery liquor.&nbsp;</p><p>One issue we encountered was a wait time for the dessert. On flagging this with our attentive server, however, they immediately brought my dessert over with a candle, a smile and a Happy Birthday wish. Guilt ensued not long after I realised that was why we waited a little longer than anticipated. It also looks like I don’t have to start saving again for our next visit - they also do a phenomenal and reasonably priced Sunday lunch too.</p><p>5 course tasting menu costs £125. Add selected Sommelier wine pairing for £75 or a Great Classic wine pairing for £130.

Tucked away down a side street, Sale e Pepe is a welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of central London.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>When we arrived at the restaurant, I was greeted by the friendly staff, who couldn't have been more attentive throughout the evening. After being shown to our table, we were soon treated to a delicious glass of Chardonnay from Umbria in Italy, which was quickly followed by an outstanding course of starters. We demolished the burrata, which is shipped in from Italy especially, as well as the warm red prawns and smoked salmon.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>The burrata was creamy yet light and perfectly complemented the saltiness of the salmon and fresh, buttery prawns.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>For mains, we opted for the grilled seabream, which was bursting with rich flavour, as well as the chicken Milanese, which was perfectly tender with a satisfyingly crispy breadcrumb coating. We paired the meal with roast potatoes, which were dangerously moreish, sautéed Broccolini, and a tomato salad.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>While we were full to bursting at this point thanks to the generous portions, we couldn't resist ordering dessert after pursuing the tempting menu. The brownie, which was blended with chocolate chip cookie had the best of both bakes, with a deliciously gooey centre and crispy exterior. The lemon meringue tart was equally as delightful - fresh, zingy and sweet.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>If you're a fan of authentic Italian food, this iconic Knightsbridge restaurant is a must.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>To book, visit <a href=#>https://www.saleepepe.co.uk/</a></p><p dir=ltr><strong>Reviewed by Nicky Morris, Senior TV and Film writer</strong><br></p><h2>Best things to do in London in May with the family</h2><p id=eHK3N5o0OT data-wc=28></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ff0b7f9398fc-matilda-the-musical.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=ff0b7f9398fc-matilda-the-musical>'Sometimes you have to be a little bit naughty' at Matilda The Musical</h2><p dir=ltr>With May delighting us with two Bank Holidays, treating yourself and the little ones of the family to a fun day out to the West End is a no brainer.
