But as one journey ends, another is always ready to begin, with <a href=#><strong>Jenn Tran</strong></a> announced as the incoming lead for <a href=#><strong>The Bachelorette</strong></a>.</p><p>That moment didn't come right away, though, as it appears Jenn may not have been producers' first choice. For weeks, fans and the media have been speculating that firecracker contestant Maria Georgas or Daisy Kent were the likely frontrunners -- with it all dependent on how Joey's season played out as Daisy was one of his final two women.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:bb42d887-2b36-4af5-aad8-c948bea28d34 data-container-ref=toofab:article:cc75699d-702b-4678-a531-3f97d0b9150a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/9c/5by4/2024/03/25/9c42b569e4064987a6e7d69fe90a4092_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis' Daughter Faces Tough Criticism as Youngest American Idol Contestant</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Well, on Monday night -- <strong>**SPOILER ALERT**</strong> -- Daisy figured out that it wasn't going to be her and rather than be rejected, it was she who walked away from Joey, leaving him to the woman he was going to choose anyway, Kelsey Anderson.</p><p>As it turns out, Daisy wasn't done walking away from things, either. <a href=#><strong>Jesse Palmer</strong></a> brought her out and hinted if she was ready to take the lead of the franchise by asking if she was ready "to open up and date again and find your person." And she basically shut it down.</p><p>"My life, the last year, has been crazy. I mean, yesterday, it's weird, it was the one year of me getting my cochlear implant, which completely changed my life," she said.</p><p>"Also, I went through this and as great of an experience it was, it was also really, really hard." she continued. "I'm healthy and I'm happy. I haven't had those two things in a really long time."</p><p>"And so right now, I know it's a time for me to focus on the things I love and the people I love. And so right now, no, I'm not ready," she concluded. "And that's okay. And I'm really proud of myself for realizing that."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0d24bea5-3a42-45af-9a22-40615ebad796 data-container-ref=toofab:article:cc75699d-702b-4678-a531-3f97d0b9150a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4d/5by4/2024/03/19/4dd12b13f8714c3e9745f6dec374770d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC/Composite</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">911's Oliver Stark Teases That Bachelor Nation Crossover: 'I Feel Really Lucky' (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>And so, it was Tran who received the metaphorical baton from the previous Bachelorette, <a href=#><strong>Charity Lawson</strong></a>.</p><p>"I can say that our next Bachelorette is someone who is intelligent," Charity told the After the Final Rose crowd. "She's witty, she's fun, and she's super kind. And personally, I want to see a lot more of her and I can only hope that out of this experience that she's getting ready to embark on that she really does find true love."</p><p>With that, Jenn hit the stage, admitting to being "overwhelmed" by the opportunity. As for what she's looking for, Jenn said, "I'm looking for someone who has a big personality." She also wants someone who can "take it as much as they can dish it."</p><p>As for her breaking new ground in representation with her casting, Jenn said, "I feel so so grateful and so honored to be the first Asian Bachelorette in this franchise. Growing up, I always wanted to see Asian representation on TV."</p><p>Saying she could never see herself as a "main character," Jenn, whose mother came to America from Vietnam, now says, "I can't help but think of how many people I'm inspiring and how many lives I am changing."</p><p>Jenn's journey to find love will air later this year.</p><a id=gallery-link-6715f421-7638-4abd-b9a5-c9baaa3fa67d class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:6715f421-7638-4abd-b9a5-c9baaa3fa67d data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:cc75699d-702b-4678-a531-3f97d0b9150a data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fa/4by3/2024/03/20/fa0b6a987b3945c6a18d209816676591_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2xma25fl66ktMSlpqudpKmybrLIq6qtZZGotqK6jJqknqqZmK6vecuemJ1lmpq7r3nTq5inZaedvG7A1Kulnpxdmby4uoyonZ%2BdomQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
