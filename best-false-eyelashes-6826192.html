These faux mink lashes are the crème de la crème for more than one reason. They’re made with soft, 100 percent synthetic fibers that look just like real lashes. On top of that, they add gorgeous wispy length and definition without being too dramatic. Lightweight with plenty of bend, these falsies are very wearable, and at times, we couldn't even feel them on our lids. Plus, these lashes were designed to fit all lash lines, which means you don’t have to measure or trim them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If we needed another reason to love them, they held up over multiple all-day wears, and the thin black base that rests snuggly on the eyelids to keep the set in place looks like jet-black eyeliner both in person and in photos. A total win-win in our book for a fun night out with lots of selfies.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Faux mink |<strong> Amount Per Pack: </strong>1 set<strong> </strong>|<strong> Glue Included: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-kiss-mlbb-my-lash-but-better-everyday-wearable-volume-false-eyelashes></span> <a href=# rel="noskim noopener nofollow sponsored" data-retailer-type=AMAZON data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" data-amazon-asin=B08R6NMT8F id=product-record__image_1-0-1 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="KISS MLBB My Lash But Better Everyday Wearable Volume False Eyelashes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/t78OUIoguwtRdPF3aV6DkQ6IVeY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/KISS-MLBB-My-Lash-But-Better-Everyday-Wearable-Volume-False-Eyelashes-194d28d0d07942759e3764f9af7c08fd.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta Beauty</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Weight</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you want to step up your makeup game, these Kiss lashes are sure to do the trick. They’re made with 100 percent synthetic faux mink hair and offer bold volume just like a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>great mascara</a>, along with extra-long length. The super-fine hairs are long and light, allowing them to bounce and move freely. Due to their extra-long length (we'll keep applying our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>lash growth serum</a> with high hopes though), these falsies work best for a cat-eye look full of drama and fun.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>application process</a>, it was one of the easiest on our list. One crucial note, however, is that the lash band itself isn’t curved, so unless your lash line is pretty straight, it may be a little tricky to get a truly natural looking bend. (If you have a more curved lash line, we suggest using half lashes as they tend to be easier to place.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Faux mink |<strong> Amount Per Pack: </strong>1 set<strong> </strong>|<strong> Glue Included: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-lilly-lashes-3d-faux-mink-lashes></span> <a href=# rel="noskim noopener nofollow sponsored" data-retailer-type=AMAZON data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" data-amazon-asin=B08KCGL394 id=product-record__image_1-0-2 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lilly Lashes 3D Faux Mink Lashes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-D_Yd1-ppszizU5nRx0OsslGkcQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lilly-Lashes-3D-Faux-Mink-Lashes-fdd5b95a265345a08d35fbcf6abdcdab.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta Beauty</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Weight</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lilly Lashes is a fan-favorite brand for a reason. For starters, they make incredible <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>magnetic lashes</a> as well as traditional options that are suited for all eye shapes. A major selling point is their flexibility — they can be altered to fit different lash lines and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>eye shapes</a>, including almond, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>hooded</a>, downturned, upturned, and more. On top of that, the application process is straightforward and easy, especially given that these lashes are so voluminous. We were expecting the lashes to feel a bit heavy, given the number of fibers on each strip and the fact that they're long enough to hit our brows, but they were surprisingly quite lightweight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, these falsies are a dream come true for anyone wanting a fluttery, flirty bit of flair. We should note once again how very long the lashes are, so you'll either need to go all-in on the glamour, or do a little snipping before applying.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Faux mink<strong> </strong>|<strong> Amount Per Pack: </strong>1 set |<strong> Glue Included: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-beginners-sephora-collection-vegan-false-eyelashes></span> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow sponsored noskim" data-retailer-type=SKIMLINKS data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" id=product-record__image_1-0-3 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Collection Vegan False Eyelashes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/VuuqzC01cLMjJ9nhimR9fHclYYk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sephora-Collection-Vegan-False-Eyelashes-bd1bfd517b2042debdf8dca672c4995f.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Weight</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Want to try fake lashes for the first time but don’t know where to start? These Sephora lashes are just the thing you need. They’re versatile, pliable, and can be adjusted to fit any lash line. But the best part? They were extremely simple to apply — as in so foolproof we thought we were doing something wrong at first — but thanks to their lightweight feel and flexible, bendy base, we felt comfortable immediately to handle them for an application that was truly no-fuss.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On top of that, these lashes provided featherlight, comfortable wear, even on the inner corner of our eyes, for hours on end. These jet-black, long lashes may lean a little too dramatic and slightly unnatural in daytime lighting, but of course, that's a matter of opinion. Regardless of when and where you want to wear them, these lashes are great for a first-timer who wants to add a little oomph to their look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Faux mink |<strong> Amount Per Pack: </strong>1 set<strong> </strong>|<strong> Glue Included: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-kit-lashify-control-kit></span> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow sponsored nocaes" data-retailer-type=SKIMLINKS data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" id=product-record__image_1-0-4 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lashify Control Kit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/x-bw2r7rpsBHLCgjcL7D2t6-6U4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lashify-control-kit-ec25ae47da8f462aa66420774e468313.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lashify</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Weight</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you want a customizable lash set that can do it all, let us introduce you to the Lashify Control Kit. This top-rated box comes with everything you need to apply false lashes, including the Fuse Control Wand that allows for seamless application, one set of lashes (you can choose between Amplify, Bold, or Curl styles), the Whisper Light Dual-Sided Bond in clear and black formulas, and a handy case that can house all of your tools.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This set gives a natural, defined look that does not budge an inch. That said, there is a steep learning curve because they don't apply like a traditional falsie. Instead, they're applied as 'slices', meaning you're applying multiple pieces — one at a time — to create the look of the whole lash. But first, you have to clean your lashes, then apply a bond, apply the glue, and predetermine the position to get the effect you want. It took us a few times to get the hang of it, but we loved the way it amplified our eye makeup for a result that appeared 100 percent natural.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Silk |<strong> Amount Per Pack: </strong>12 lashes<strong> </strong>|<strong> Glue Included: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-half-lashes-lilly-lashes-butterfleyes-3d-faux-mink-half-lashes></span> <a href=# rel="noskim noopener nofollow sponsored" data-retailer-type=AMAZON data-tracking-id=commerce-widget data-click-action="image click" data-amazon-asin=B0CBL943Y5 id=product-record__image_1-0-5 class="product-record__image product__image mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lilly Lashes Butterfl'eyes 3D Faux Mink Half Lashes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/SOANejPbg_9FysLXnOlG61FmjPk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lilly-Lashes-ButterflEyes-3D-Faux-Mink-Half-Lashes-36a4a2510da54a3da06d2a3bfd69d5c8.jpg"></a> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta Beauty</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Weight</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Want to add natural-looking length to lashes? These semi-wispy, fluttery half-lashes will do all that and more. They’re easy to apply and add the ideal amount of volume. Plus, the lash extension is very lightweight — it didn’t feel like there was anything on top of our natural lashes. In terms of durability, we gave these lashes a perfect five-star rating due to their durability holding up throughout a full days' wear. In fact, we felt like we could use and reuse them for a long time (the brand says that they can be worn up to 25 times).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though the band is half the size of typical falsies (hence the term “half lash”), those with smaller eyes may still have to trim them to get a more natural effect.

These three styles all work to create different beauty looks and varying degrees of drama.&nbsp;<p>Usually, strip lashes are best for high-drama glam results since they often feature bold lashes with crisscross patterns for extended length. On the other hand, individual flare lashes are great for natural, everyday beauty looks. These lashes come individually (hence their name), so you can apply as many or as few as you’d like. Finally, corner or half lashes were made to lift the outer corners of the eyes.</p></li><li><strong>Ability to Reuse</strong>: Most false eyelashes can be reused multiple times. In fact, some lashes are actually made to be re-worn, which is better for your wallet and for the world. To properly reuse falsies, be sure to clean them after each use — just wet a Q-tip or cotton round with face wash or false lash cleaner and gently wipe away any leftover glue. Once they're clean, let them dry. If you're consistent about washing them after every use, you'll be able to get 15 to 20 wears out of each set.</li><li><strong>Glue</strong>: Finding the right eyelash glue for your falsies is equally as important as finding good lashes. To find the best glue for you, be sure to check the ingredient list to ensure you’re not allergic to anything. (Some lash adhesives are made with latex, which can irritate eyes and eyelids.) Once you’ve checked out the ingredients, determine what color glue you want. Do you want it to be clear or black? This usually goes hand-in-hand with what kind of makeup look you’re going for (bold or natural). From there, be sure you’re applying a thin line of glue along the falsies’ lash line.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you apply false lashes?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Bychkova, the best way to apply fake eyelashes is by first measuring the length of the band compared to your lid. “Often, you might need to cut the lash to fit your eye size,” she explains. “Use small manicure scissors and always cut starting from the outer corner of the lash (i.e., from the side where the lashes are the longest).” &nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once you’ve done that, prep your skin for the falsies. “If you're not wearing eyeshadow, put some loose setting powder on to ensure your lids are not too oily, as it might impact how a lash glue sticks to your skin,” says Bychkova.
