Interested in acting, the girl quickly directed her interests that aligned with her passion. She began with a TV commercial and then moved to her first appearance on television through Goin’ Bulilit. The show was a popular children’s show. This cinematic exposure opened several other doors for the budding actress. She later contributed to some drama series in ABS-CBN. Then came her big break in 2010 when she engraved her name as one of the most popular actors in the drama series Alyana. In the show, she portrayed the character of Sofia Alvaro, the protagonist’s lost daughter.</p><p>This strong base helped young Brillantes cement her position in front of the camera firmly. In 2012, the girl expanded her acting skills with the role of Princess. So, how did a part increase her flexibility? Well, the character was a boyish girl who believed in fairy tales. The show revolved around the concept of fantasy science fiction.</p><p>Similarly, in 2013, she got chosen to play a role, adding that extra star to her portfolio. She skillfully completed her leading role in the drama series Annaliza. This was the first time she led the whole series as the main character. As the character Annaliza developed her style in the series as a young girl away from her real family, Andrea grew personally, too.</p><p>A year later, the budding artist marked her return to the television career with a role in the drama Hawak Kamay. The show is a typical family drama, and already established, Andrea played the role of Lorrie. The performance got superb appreciation from the audience side. Respecting her effort in the series, she got the Yahoo! Celebrity Award as the Child Star of the Year. The girl also secured her position in the remake of the iconic drama series Pangako Sa ‘Yo, which aired in 2015.</p><p>Enough of the series credits; what about her movie credits? Well, the girl has accumulated quite a few credits under her name for contributions to movies like Father Jejemon (2010), Crazy Beautiful You (2015), Kahit Ayaw Mo Na (2018), Banal (2019), and Spark (2019) to name a few. Andrea is a part of the drama series entitled Kadenang Ginto, which airs via ABS-CBN. She plays the role of Marga, surprisingly the antagonist of the series.</p><p>With all these successes in her career, the Philippines-native has an estimated net worth of $2 million. These include all her earnings from movie and TV series contributions. Also, we have to consider the countless endorsements and commercials she frequently does. People are getting head over heels for the girl, and the situation is escalating thanks to different local magazines featuring her on magazine covers. Brillantes also has her cosmetic line called the Blythe Cosmetics, which operates under Careline. These products will also add up to her revenue.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Dating_Life><strong>Dating Life</strong></span></h3><p>Thousands of male fans were heartbroken in 2019 when Andrea started dating rumours with her co-star Kyle Echarri.
