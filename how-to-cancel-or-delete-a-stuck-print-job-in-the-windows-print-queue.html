Navigate to %windir%\System32\spool\PRINTERS, delete all the temporary files there, and then start the Print Spooler service again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sometimes, documents you're printing&nbsp;get stuck in the printer's queue, preventing further&nbsp;documents from being printed. Here's how to fix it when that happens.</p><p>Whether you're using a local or <a href=#>shared network printer</a>, sometimes printing doesn't go quite right. If you've tried <a href=#>troubleshooting&nbsp;obvious printer problems</a>---paper jams, no paper, low ink or toner, or simply restarting the printer---it's time to turn your attention toward the print queue. Often, simply clearing and restarting the print spooler---the software that prepares and manages printing documents---can fix the problem. If that fails, you may need to cancel one or more documents in your print queue and see if that gets things going again.</p><p>This should work in Windows Vista, 7, 8, 10, and 11.</p><p>Windows 7, 8, 10, and 11 all have different user interfaces. In this case, it shouldn't affect the process very much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=clear-and-restart-the-print-spooler>Clear and Restart the Print Spooler</h2><p>Clearing and restarting the print spooler should be your first step when trying to fix stuck print jobs because it won't actually cancel any of your currently printing documents. Instead, it restarts things and proceeds as if all those documents had just been sent to the printer for the first time.</p><p>To do this, you'll stop the Print Spooler service, delete the temporary cache Windows uses to spool print jobs, and then start the service again.&nbsp;We're going to show you two ways to do this. First, we'll look at how to do it manually, and then we'll look at how to create a batch script so that you can do it any time you want with just a click.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Troubleshoot Printer Problems on a Windows PC</a></span></p><h3 id=clear-and-restart-the-print-spooler-manually>Clear and Restart the Print Spooler Manually</h3><p>To clear and restart the print spooler manually, you'll first need to stop the Print Spooler service.&nbsp;Click Start, type "services," and then click the Services app.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cpj_8.png><p>In the right-hand pane of the Services window, find and double-click the "Print Spooler" service to open its properties window.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cpj_9.png><p>In the properties window, on the "General" tab, click the "Stop" button.

Open the "File" menu and click the "Save As" command. In the "Save As" window, browse to the location you want to save the file.

Sometimes, clearing a single stuck document will get your printer going again and any other print jobs in the queue can finish printing normally. Other times, you might have to cancel all the currently printing documents and then try printing them again.</p><p>Click Start, type "devices," and then click the "Devices and Printers" Control Panel app.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cpj_1.png><p>In the Devices and Printers window, right-click the printer you're having trouble with and then click the "See what's printing" command to open the print queue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cpj_2.png><p>The print queue window shows the print jobs currently awaiting printing. If a single document is causing the problem and you have more than one document in the queue, it's usually the earliest document that's stuck. Click the header for the "Submitted" column so that the documents&nbsp;are arranged in the order they were submitted, with the earliest at the top. Note that in our example, we arranged the columns so they would fit in our screenshot better, so your "Submitted" column may be further to the right.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cpj_3-1.png><p>Right-click the earliest print job and then select "Restart" from the context menu.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cpj_4-1.png><p>If your printer cranks up and starts printing after restarting the document, you're good to go.

If the document didn't get canceled at all---or if the document did get canceled but printing is still not happening---you'll need to try canceling all the documents in the queue. Click the "Printer" menu and then choose the "Cancel all documents" command.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cpj_7-1.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All the documents in the queue should disappear and you can try printing a new document to see if it works.</p><p>If restarting the print spooler and clearing documents from the print queue didn't fix your printing problem---and your printer was working successfully previously---then you'll likely need to turn your attention toward things like updating or reinstalling your printer drivers or moving on to whatever diagnostics are provided by the manufacturer of your printer.
