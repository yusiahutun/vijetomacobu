Made from injection-moulded EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate) in predominantly slip-on styles that come in a rainbow of colours, the shoes are coveted as much for their style as they are for their comfort.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With a home audience that fiercely values work-life balance, Native has found Vancouver to be a fertile backdrop for products that demand high performance in various scenarios.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Sneakers: from sports shoes to celebrity-backed must-haves</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our designs are inspired by Vancouver’s unique embrace of an outdoor culture that’s highly blended into the work culture,” Belgue says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our Audrey [d’Orsay style shoe] is a perfect example: you can wear it to a beach in the morning and get it wet in the ocean, head over to lunch with friends in the city and later that afternoon attend a work meeting, all in the same day, in the same shoes.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Arc’teryx is a company that manufactures technical high-performance apparel, outerwear and equipment. Located in North Vancouver at the foot of the North Shore Mountains, its design and production facilities are minutes away from outdoor environments that offer everything from gentle recreational fun to extremely harsh conditions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/16/98417694-a904-11e9-862b-600d112f3b14_972x_042831.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/16/b9724c4e-a904-11e9-862b-600d112f3b14_972x_042831.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Named after archaeopteryx lithographica, the first reptile to develop feathers for flight, the company was founded in 1989 by a group of local climbers who made high-end climbing harnesses. Today it reaches a broader audience, intent on making the extreme wilderness more accessible to anyone who is willing to try.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We chose to operate in Vancouver because it provides a safe place to experiment with new materials, techniques, equipment, technologies and emerging products,” says Verity King, global public relations manager at Arc’teryx. “Operating in our own backyard is a vital and unique advantage.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Back in the city, Aritzia rules the urban jungle. Its Chevalier blazer, Cohen trouser, winter parka and blanket scarf are all iconic items to Vancouver fashion shoppers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/16/d9eb9c82-a904-11e9-862b-600d112f3b14_972x_042831.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aritzia began in 1984 as an in-house label within a smaller boutique, Hill’s of Kerrisdale. Back then, Vancouver was coming out of its spandex-and-shoulder-pads phase and the rise of Aritzia paralleled, if not fuelled, Vancouver’s interest in more fashion-forward options.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Today, its Vancouver flagship on Robson Street is comprised of four interconnected retail spaces that in total stretches half a city block.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If you grew up in Vancouver, you know about Aritzia’s legendary annual summer warehouse sale. The event lasts nearly a week, is located in Vancouver’s huge new convention centre, and is guaranteed to draw massive crowds including several dozen people who will have camped out overnight.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The annual Aritzia warehouse sale is a shopping institution in this city,” says Aleesha Harris, arts and life editor at The Vancouver Sun newspaper. “It’s epic.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/16/116dc040-a905-11e9-862b-600d112f3b14_972x_042831.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her top shopping strategies? First, target specific categories such as denim, outerwear or scarves, because you’ll exhaust yourself if you go in with a “just browsing” mentality. Second, go with someone who can help pass the hours while lining up. Finally: “You just have to get up ridiculously early. Grab a coffee and get in line.” It’s a Vancouver rite of passage.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Aritzia’s influence on Vancouver was slow and steady, Lululemon’s was explosive.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Vancouver serves as the perfect testing ground for developing innovative technical athletic gear,” says Stuart Haselden, chief operating officer and executive vice-president international at the company. “Our business was born from a love of daily sweat … and Vancouver is a city that truly reflects the sweat life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/16/5e84d2ce-a905-11e9-862b-600d112f3b14_972x_042831.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Vancouver fully embraced Lululemon from the beginning, first for its chic yoga wear but soon after for its introduction of a whole new category of clothing: athleisure. The label grew beyond activewear and into a lifestyle brand, evidenced most recently by the launch of its new line of self-care products.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Haselden recognises Vancouver as an important part of Lululemon’s heritage but that “the sweat life translates across geographies, backgrounds, age and gender”. He acknowledges that international markets, Asia in particular, is where the brand’s future lies, and it recently opened its first airport store, in Hong Kong International’s Terminal 1.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There are exciting long-term growth opportunities for Lululemon as communities around the world increasingly pursue an active, mindful lifestyle,” he says. “We are seeing an exceptionally strong guest response, especially in China where in Q1 we saw nearly 70 per cent total market growth and digital grew 100 per cent.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/16/954ef0aa-a905-11e9-862b-600d112f3b14_972x_042831.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Herschel Supply, the vision from the beginning was to sell its distinctive products overseas. In its first year, the products were available in eight countries.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We always planned to be a global brand, because we felt the problem we were trying to solve … was always bigger than what was in our backyard,” says Lyndon Cormack, co-founder of Herschel. And that problem? “Backpacks were boring.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/16/1b876cac-a905-11e9-862b-600d112f3b14_972x_042831.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/16/37d22834-a905-11e9-862b-600d112f3b14_972x_042831.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In just 10 years, Herschel backpacks have come to dominate airport lounges, university campuses and fitness gyms all around the world. The company also now offers luggage, apparel and travel accessories, but it’s the backpacks that have remained virtually unchanged since inception, and which have made Herschel a global brand.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And yet, despite its far-reaching goals, the company is resolute about its roots.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Vancouver is part of Herschel’s DNA. We never contemplated being anywhere else. If anything, the multicultural community in Vancouver helps us understand the globe a lot better … We also have a special relationship with the outdoors here and that definitely affects the way we think about design.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/16/46c0e74a-a905-11e9-862b-600d112f3b14_972x_042831.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Vancouver, these brands have changed the way we dress, board planes, and look at mountains as challenges and not obstacles.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“People are extremely active in this city, whether it’s within the community, sports or health,” Cormack says. “It’s almost like ‘doing stuff’ and experiencing the outdoors is kind of social currency.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Spoken like a true Vancouverite.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlkpqutsDYaJirrJmYuaZ7kmlpa21kaXytwcuuo56ln6N6or7CrZyrsahis6rCxGatmqaTpMK3sdFmmauZnpnAbq7UoqOtZZOewbq%2F</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
