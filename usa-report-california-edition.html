Hiring the best engineers and having world-class processes, equipment and tools under one roof, D&K Engineering designs and manufactures breakthrough hardware-based products that lead to profitable and enduring lines of business.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"The innovation horsepower is at our core," says CEO Scott Dennis, who co-founded the company with Alex Kunczynski in 1999. "The continuous interaction between our research and development (R&D) and manufacturing teams allows us to shrink time to market, reduce costs and improve the quality of results for companies."&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A global leader in end-to-end product realisation services focused on leading-edge content, D&K Engineering serves a variety of sectors - from robotics, electromechanical and medical devices to 3D printing and smart machines. Having developed more than 200 products since its foundation, D&K Engineering serves a diverse mix of Fortune 500 companies, middle capitalisation firms and start-ups.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Serving multiple market segments helps us apply business techniques in adjacent markets," Dennis says. "As a manufacturer, we help clients create innovative designs and products, but as a partner we also help them create a strategy for success by delivering advanced solutions and services that solve real problems."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From its humble beginnings as a top-tier product development and manufacturing company in San Diego, California, D&K Engineering has grown to become an agile international player, nurturing cooperation with the world's largest suppliers and R&D firms. Its global supply chain network extends to Asia with its Singapore office managing the company's customer and supplier relationships in the region. The Singapore base also mirrors the company's R&D, prototyping and manufacturing activities in its headquarters in the United States.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With partnerships becoming the natural order in an increasingly knowledge-based global economy, D&K Engineering welcomes more alliances particularly with well-established suppliers in Malaysia, as it moves towards areas where innovation organically flows.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><img aria-label=loading data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-v2.i-scmp.com/production/_next/static/media/wheel-on-gray.af4a55f9.gif style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLDBza2psmWimr2wvtOsZputo567pr%2FSaKuoqJmYwHDB0ppkq52gpL%2B1ecKao6Ken6e7qq2MnpuirJmku3Ct0a2gnKSVZH55f5JsbG1nmaO7sMLAraCopl2dvLO%2FxKmmsJ2i</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
