And while soundbars usually work just fine, problems are inevitable and frustrating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully, soundbar problems are fairly easy to pin down. And you can always go nuclear with a factory reset, if necessary. Here are some common soundbar problems, plus the solutions you're searching for.</p><h2 id=before-troubleshooting-try-these-quick-fixes>Before Troubleshooting, Try These Quick Fixes</h2><p>By default, your smart TV should choose the correct audio settings for your soundbar. And for this reason, soundbar problems are usually due to software bugs, bad cables, or the settings of an external video source (such as a DVD player, streaming stick, cable box, or game console).</p><p>So, before diving into this article for your specific problem, try the following solutions:</p><ul><li><strong>Power Cycle</strong>: Try unplugging your TV and soundbar from the wall for at least 10 seconds. This forces the TV and soundbar to reestablish their connection, which can solve glitches and other problems. (The power button doesn't completely turn these devices off, hence the need to unplug them.)</li><li><strong>Check Soundbar Audio Source</strong>: Your soundbar may be trying to play audio from the wrong source. Select your desired input (usually HDMI or optical) from a button on the soundbar or its remote.</li><li><strong>Firmware Update</strong>: If your soundbar suddenly stops working properly, or if a new soundbar just won't work, a smart TV firmware update may be the answer to your problems. Be sure to power cycle your TV and soundbar after the update is installed. (If you prefer to keep your smart TV offline, you can disconnect it from the internet after updating.)</li><li><strong>Check Your Connections</strong>: Make sure that there aren't any loose connections between your TV and soundbar. If your soundbar and TV are connected via HDMI cable, be sure that you're using the HDMI ARC or eARC jack on both devices. (And if you're using Bluetooth, try a wired connection)</li><li><strong>Try Another Cable</strong>: Even the best HDMI cables break. Try using a new one. I suggest buying an <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">HDMI 2.1 cable</a>, as it will support both the HDMI ARC and eARC standards.</li><li><strong>Check Video Source Settings</strong>: Your streaming stick, cable box, DVD player, or game console may be the source of your problems. Check its audio settings---enable "comfort noise" if available, set its audio output mode to "auto," and calibrate any audio sync settings if available.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, some problems may be resolved by a factory reset. You can factory reset both your smart TV and soundbar by following the manufacturer's instructions---the process differs from brand to brand, so consult your instruction manuals or perform a Google search for your equipment's manuals.</p><h2 id=soundbar-won-t-connect-to-the-tv>Soundbar Won't Connect to the TV</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/a96b41a6.png> Andrew Heinzman / Review Geek<p>Soundbars are very easy to set up, and generally speaking, you shouldn't have any problems if you follow the manufacturer's instructions. But here are some steps that you can take if your soundbar won't connect to your TV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><b>Follow the Instruction Manual</b>: I know it's preachy, but you should really follow the manufacturer's instructions when installing a soundbar.</li><li><strong>Check Your Cables</strong>: Look for any loose connections between your TV and soundbar. If you're using an HDMI ARC or eARC connection, make sure you're using the correct ports on your TV and soundbar. They should be labeled "ARC" or "eARC."</li><li><strong>Try a New Cable</strong>: HDMI cables can break, and older HDMI cables may not support the ARC or eARC standards. So, try a new cable. If HDMI gives you trouble, try optical or AUX.</li><li><strong>Set Your TV's Audio Output</strong>: Go into your smart TV's settings and make sure that the correct audio output is selected. If you're currently on the "auto" setting, try the "AMP," "audio system," or "digital" setting instead. (If these steps don't work, reenable the "auto" setting.)</li><li><strong>Try Disabling eARC</strong>: Some soundbars and HDMI cables don't support eARC. Try disabling the eARC setting on your smart TV. (If disabling eARC doesn't fix anything, reenable it! The eARC standard provides higher-quality sound than basic HDMI ARC.)</li><li><strong>Enable HDMI-CEC</strong>: Open your TV's settings and <a href=#>enable HDMI-CEC</a>. This allows your TV and soundbar to communicate.</li><li><strong>Firmware Update</strong>: Try updating your TV's firmware. It sounds silly, but it often works.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When all else fails, consult your soundbar's instruction manual to perform a factory reset.

This may be achieved using additional speakers, though it's not uncommon for a standalone soundbar to offer virtual surround sound through&nbsp;DTS X or DTS Virtual:X. Thankfully, if your soundbar isn't outputting surround sound audio, the problem is usually easy to fix.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First, let me explain something. If your soundbar came with a bunch of extra speakers, you're enjoying Dolby Atmos audio. Soundbars with DTS X reproduce a genuine surround sound signal (using several channels of audio from your video source), while DTS Virtual:X takes basic stereo audio and converts it to a multi-channel format.</p><ul><li><strong>Check Your Content</strong>: Some shows, movies, and streaming apps are only mixed for stereo audio. Obviously, this doesn't matter when using DTS Virtual:X.</li><li><strong>Soundbar Settings</strong>: Check your soundbar's settings using the included remote (or TV interface, if available). You may need to manually enable surround sound. Note that a soundbar's "music" mode will turn off any of your surround or rear speakers, while "all channel stereo" will play 2.0-channel stereo audio through all of your speakers.</li><li><strong>TV and Video Source Settings</strong>: Check your TV and video source settings, as they may be set to "stereo." I've run into this problem with game consoles and streaming sticks.</li><li><strong>Cable Choice</strong>: Be sure to use an <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">HDMI 2.1</a> cable for full HDMI ARC and eARC support. If surround sound is a priority, skip the optical cable, as it lacks the bandwidth of HDMI.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These steps should solve most surround sound problems. Unfortunately, surround sound is a difficult topic with a lot of moving parts. For additional help, you'll need to consult your soundbar's manual or contact the manufacturer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/41iw0k5rg-s-_sl500_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Monoprice 8K Certified Braided Ultra High-Speed HDMI 2.1 Cable</h5><span>Best HDMI 2.1 Cable</span><p class=display-card-description>If you're looking to add an HDMI 2.1 cable to your arsenal of cables and connectors, this 8K Certified model from Monoprice is a terrific pick.</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$19 at Amazon</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">Target</a><h2 id=video-and-audio-are-out-of-sync>Video and Audio Are Out of Sync</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/45655d93.jpg> Justin Duino / Review Geek<p>The software in your TV and soundbar should prevent any audiovisual syncing issues. But if your video is ahead of your audio, or vice-versa, there are a few steps you can take to resolve the problem.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Test Your TV's Speakers</strong>: Unplug your soundbar or disable it within your TV's settings. Then, see if your TV's built-in speakers are out of sync. If so, try updating your smart TV's firmware, or perform a factory reset following the manufacturer's instructions.</li><li><strong>Test Input Sources</strong>: Test a variety of video sources with your TV. Your DVD player, streaming stick, cable box, or game console may be responsible for audiovisual problems. If so, check if your video source has an "Audio/Video Sync" or "Lip Sync" setting. (I've encountered this problem on a few Android streaming sticks.)</li><li><strong>Plug Everything Into Your Soundbar</strong>: Instead of plugging video sources into your TV, plug them into your soundbar's HDMI ports. This can resolve audiovisual sync problems and video decoding problems. (Note that this setup requires HDMI ARC or eARC.)</li><li><strong>Test Streaming Apps</strong>: If audiovisual problems only occur in one streaming app, that particular app is probably to blame. You can try updating or reinstalling the app, but you may need to wait for a fix from the app developer. (This issue may also indicate a problem with your soundbar's Dolby Atmos processing.)</li><li><strong>Turn Off Audio Processing</strong>: Soundbars often feature audio processing technologies that imitate surround sound. Try turning off audio processing or virtualized Dolby Atmos on your soundbar, or set your TV's output to PCM. Note that these settings may reduce audio quality.</li><li><strong>Adjust&nbsp;Your TV Settings</strong>: Your TV may offer an "Audio/Video Sync" or "Lip Sync" setting.</li><li><strong>Switch to Wired Audio</strong>: Wireless audio, such as Bluetooth, can introduce a ton of latency. I suggest using a wired connection whenever possible.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Can't Hear Dialogue on TV?

If you're using one of these connection methods, try the following:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Increase Audio Output</strong>: Turn down your soundbar and increase the volume of your TV. This ensures that the soundbar receives a powerful audio signal, which should prevent the energy-saver mode from kicking in.</li><li><strong>Comfort Noise</strong>: Your smart TV or streaming stick may offer a "comfort noise" setting, which provides a continuous audio signal to the soundbar (outside the range of human hearing). If you can find this setting, make sure that it's enabled.</li><li><strong>Check Your Cables</strong>: A faulty cable may be responsible for this problem. Try swapping in a new cable, or switch to an HDMI ARC or eARC connection if possible.</li></ul><p>But what if you encounter this problem while using an HDMI ARC or eARC connection?

These wireless subwoofers are supposed to automatically pair with your soundbar, but if you encounter a problem, the following steps should help you get the bass pumping.</p><ul><li><strong>Flip the Subwoofer's Power Switch</strong>: Wireless subwoofers usually have a power switch. Ensure that your subwoofer is powered on. The subwoofer should use an LED to indicate its power status. (If your subwoofer won't turn on, try a different outlet.)</li><li><strong>Power Cycle Everything</strong>: Unplug your soundbar, smart TV, and subwoofer from the wall for at least 10 seconds. This may resolve connection issues between the soundbar and subwoofer.</li><li><strong>Check for a Pairing Button</strong>: If your wireless subwoofer has a pairing button, press and hold it for about 30 seconds (while your soundbar and TV are turned on).</li><li><strong>Move Your Subwoofer</strong>: Try moving your subwoofer closer to the TV. Something may be obstructing its wireless signal.</li><li><strong>Check Your Settings</strong>: Your wireless subwoofer may be disabled due to settings on your smart TV or soundbar. Try toggling settings like "quiet mode" or "night mode." Note that your soundbar may have dedicated settings that can only be accessed with its original remote control.</li><li><strong>Factory Reset Your Soundbar</strong>: You can always factory reset your soundbar.
