That is what makes Pleats Please Issey Miyake such a phenomenon. Distinguished by fine, concertina pleats that expand and retract as the wearer moves, this innovative fabric transcends decades and trends, and it has been worn by everyone from Zaha Hadid to Kim Kardashian. It’s beautiful but it’s hardy. It’s special but it’s democratic. It has a wonderfully anonymous quality, while remaining identifiable to those in the know – or rather, in the fold.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Pleats Please officially launched in 1993, several years after the idea first began percolating in Issey Miyake’s mind. The Hiroshima-born designer began dreaming up new concepts in 1989, after an exhibition of his work was held at Musée des Arts Décoratifs.</p><img alt="street style" title="Street Style - Paris Fashion Week - Menswear Spring/Summer 2023 : Day Three" width=683 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/couple-seen-wearing-blue-dress-yellow-shirt-pants-sandals-news-photo-1692179713.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Christian Vierig</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"After the exhibition, I became convinced that I had already accomplished everything that I could," he says in the book 'Pleats Please Issey Miyake' (Taschen, 2012). "And so I began to think about a new journey upon which to embark."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Miyake’s interest was piqued by a scarf that had been processed with fine, angled pleats. The designer concedes that pleating evokes ideas of haute couture – and certainly, he cut his teeth in the ateliers of couturiers including Guy Laroche and Hubert de Givenchy – but that wasn’t his intention.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Pleated dresses invoke Fortuny's glorious designs from the early 20th century," he said. "But I was not interested in the style of haute couture that required maintenance and careful handling that he had created." Instead, Pleats Please was to be as universal and wearable as jeans and T-shirts, a maxim Miyake had committed to after witnessing the French student revolt of 1968, which prompted him to rethink his design outlook, vowing to make unstuffy, joyful clothes that offered the wearer freedom.</p><img alt="pleats please" title="pleats please" width=1822 height=1366 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pleats-please-1-64dc9cbc41049.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Masaya Yoshimura</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was dance that spurred the designer to develop his initial work with pleats, after creating pleated costumes for William Forsythe’s Frankfurt Ballet Company and witnessing the dancers in rehearsals.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"From the moment they slipped into their costumes, they just started to move," Miyake said. "They were crazy about my pleats. That's when it hit me. If dancers with such a wide range of body types and height had so much fun wearing them, ordinary people might, too."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Miyake and his team set about researching and developing the ideal fabric for this new offering (separate from the designer’s mainline collections). The final, perfected product was crafted from high-quality polyester, specially developed for its weightlessness and softness, and which could be permanently pleats-processed with heat. Crucially, the price of the garments couldn’t be prohibitive, which would have almost certainly been the case had Miyake chosen a natural fabric; after all, a garment pleated in this way requires a piece of fabric almost three times its intended size.</p><img alt="street style" title="Street Style - Paris Fashion Week - Menswear Fall-Winter 2023-2024 : Day Three" width=1024 height=683 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/daniel-toni-jais-and-nathalie-larch-c3-a9-seen-wearing-total-news-photo-1692179940.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jeremy Moeller</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Pleats Please was resistant to wrinkles and static, and could be washed, rolled up and transported without losing its distinguishing characteristic, those wonderful, precise pleats – achieved via an intricate process of folding, ironing, sewing, and heat pressing. The transportability of Pleats Please was an important detail, given that many Japanese women were eschewing homemaking for the corporate world and business travel – this was largely thanks to the Equal Employment Opportunity Law, which had been enacted in 1986, some years before the label’s launch.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It is our job as designers [...] to create clothes from materials in such a way that those who wear them have the freedom of expression and its resulting joy," Miyake had said. This mission was most certainly accomplished, best demonstrated by the leaping, Pleats Please-wearing dancers in Francis Giacobetti’s photos for the brand, shot between 1999 and 2001.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">Shop Pleats Please</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="pleats please issey miyake" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pleats-please-issey-miyake-daily-pleated-woven-tote-bag-64dca095e3230.jpg title="pleats please issey miyake" width=1020 height=1328 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In Pleats Please, Miyake had magicked up a capsule wardrobe of dresses, trousers, tops, skirts and cardigans in paintbox brights that could be mixed or matched, for virtually every occasion – and certainly, some collectors dress almost exclusively in items from the line. A Pleats Please dress or set can be worn for a casual coffee with friends or for a special dinner; it can be donned on the plane (after all, it won’t crease) and then worn straight to a client meeting, no costume change required. Those masterful, mercurial pleats look good on people of all ages and sizes. They are sculptural but not ostentatiously so, projecting a cool air of authority. They are identifiable to disciples of good design, and no less pleasing to everyone else.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s no wonder then that Pleats Please has become something of a uniform for people of style and substance, from architects and artists to musicians and models. Fans include the late architect Zaha Hadid, pianist Mitsuko Uchida, essayist Masako Shirasu, and singer-songwriters Solange Knowles and Joni Mitchell – an eclectic and accomplished cast (who, incidentally, would make for a dream dinner party guest list).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Over the decades, Pleats Please has expanded to include more maximalist designs, as well as the staple, single-shade separates, pleasingly released by colour in monthly drops. The brand turned 30 in May but just like so many of its wearers, it defies age.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/a40844034/issey-miyake-death/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Miyake, who passed away last August" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Miyake, who passed away last August</a>, Pleats Please was something of a magnum opus. "Among the many clothes that I have created over the last four decades as a clothing designer, Pleats Please is the one that I really call my own," he said. "Of course I have presented at the Paris collections, but Pleats Please is what I consider my most valuable contribution to 'design'."</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Highlights from the A/W 2023 Couture Shows" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/2023-hbz-aw23couture-thumb-1-64ae6d09d49db.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSudYCXa25paGhkva2xwK2qZqicmq60sYyiqqydqWK6qsXApJxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
