Joey Graziadei, a 28-year-old professional tennis player from Koloa, Hawaii, and the runner-up on The Bachelorette Season 20 with Charity Lawson, was announced as the Season 28 Bachelor at The Bachelorette Season 20 “After the Final Rose” special in August 2023. “It’s sinking in very slowly but I’m trying my best just to stay present, enjoy it, but this is crazy. I mean, I’ll be the first person to say this is wild. I never expected this at all, didn’t know this is what my life is turning at this moment. So yeah, crazy stuff, but I’m excited,” Joey said.</p><p>Joey, who called the experience “surreal,” told host Jesse Palmer that he felt ready to look for love again after Charity sent him home at the Final Rose Ceremony over her winner, Dotun Olubeko. “I’m more ready than I was in that moment,” Joey said. “For me, it was just, you have to take some time to get a little bit more closure. Watching Dotun and Charity’s connection was enough for me.”</p><p>Joey, who claimed that the breakup “opened up a part of me that wanted something so bad,” also told Palmer what he was looking for in a future partner. “Someone that’s just themselves that I can truthfully be a partner with. I want someone that challenges me. I want someone that I can challenge. I just want someone to do life with. I just want someone that’s going to be my person,” he said.</p><p>During The Bachelorette Season 20 “After the Final Rose” special, Joey also met his first contestant, Leia, who was in the audience for the live taping. “I think we have a lot in common, so I’m excited to kind of explore that,” Leia told Joey during the episode. In an <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> video after the “After the Final Rose” special, Joey confirmed that was the Bachelor for the right reasons. “I’m definitely the hopeless romantic,” he said. “I want to be married. I want to have a love that lasts a lifetime. So I’m really ready to go on this journey.”</p><p>In an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in August 2023, Charity commended Joey for a conversation they had about interracial relationships during her Bachelorette season. “It’s huge to have had the opportunity to have that conversation, and then for it to be aired on national television — we don’t see it a lot, especially in this franchise. It was something that I was a little nervous about because I just did not know how it was going to go,” she said. “But my whole plan of being a Black woman in this lead role is having these important conversations. Also, there were conversations that I had with several other men that did not make air, and that’s OK. But it was one of my priorities to have conversations about something that’s extremely important to me and that would essentially become a very important part of their lives, too, if they ended up with me.”</p><p>In a blog post in July 2023, Reality Steve named Joey as The Bachelorette Season 20 contestant most likely to become the next Bachelor for Season 28. “I know Joey fans won’t be happy, but it is what it is,” Reality Steve wrote about Joey not receiving Charity’s Final Rose. “I’m sure he’s got a great shot for Bachelor, so I guess just hope for that. He seems to have the biggest following of Charity’s men and will be the sentimental favorite once Charity breaks up with him at final rose ceremony. So you’d think he’s got a good shot at it, but who knows.”</p><p>Read Joey’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Bachelorette 2023 biography</a> and fun facts ahead:</p><p>“’Love’ may mean nothing in tennis, but to Joey, it’s everything!
