It’s been huge for us to see that.”</p><p>The family trio out of South Bend, Ind., floored the coaches with their version of the Jimmy Webb-penned hit. Their sibling harmonies were nearly flawless and provided listeners with a heavenly take on the classic tune.</p><p>Forbes, who earned a four-chair turn with her blind audition performance of Elton John’s “Rocket Man,” also blew the coaches away with a rousing rendition of “Superstar” by the Carpenters. Her take on the song sparked an instantaneous positive reaction from judges <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a> and <a href=#>John Legend</a>.</p><p>Clarkson knew both artists were promising winners in the competition, but she had to go with her gut, and admitted she had a strategy she was working with. She ultimately picked Girl Named Tom as the winner of the Knockout Round.</p><p>However, even though Forbes didn’t win over Clarkson with her performance of "Superstar," she ended up getting her pick between Legend and Grande due to a double steal. Forbes will now head into the live shows&nbsp;representing Team Ariana.</p><p>The Voice returns Tuesday (Oct. 26) at 8PM ET on NBC.</p><p><strong>WATCH: Has The Voice Changed Blake Shelton?</strong></p><p><strong>The Voice Stars, Then + Now:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoKGioXqvrcyem2asn6J6tbTEZq2ooZOaeri1wqGgrZldobavscyapWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
