On one hand, larger speakers tend to sound better and offer more volume, but they sacrifice some easy portability in the process. Likewise, smaller speakers may have less volume, but they're far easier to carry.</p><p>Weather resistance is another important factor when shopping for a portable speaker. Every speaker we're looking at here features an <a href=#>IP rating</a>, which describes how weather-resistant a given speaker is. If you're mainly using your speaker indoors, you can disregard this, but the higher the IP rating, the more water and dust-resistant a speaker is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another major aspect to consider is the battery life. If you're only using your speaker for an hour or two a day and frequently recharging, this doesn't matter as much. That said, if you're looking for a speaker to bring with you on a weekend trip, a bigger battery (which is measured in <a href=#>milliamp hours</a>) will let you leave the charger at home.</p><p>Of course, while most <a href=#>boomboxes</a> feature built-in playback methods like an FM radio or built-in CD player, portable speakers don't. Instead, you'll need to rely on an external device like your phone for music. The most common way you'll connect is via Bluetooth, but some portable speakers offer alternate wireless connectivity options like Wi-Fi.</p><p>Finally, there are the other features offered by each speaker to consider. Some speakers offer a built-in power bank to charge your other devices, while others let you link multiple speakers for louder music or stereo sound. We'll point these extra features for each speaker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><td colspan=3 style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p><strong>How Did We Research</strong></p></td></tr><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Models Evaluated</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Hours Researched</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Reviews Analyzed</p></td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>12</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>4</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>19</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>How-To Geek's product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

The <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Sonos Move</a> takes everything great about Sonos speakers and packs it into a portable package that works wonderfully at home and on the road.</p><p>As is typical for a Sonos speaker, the Move features Wi-Fi connectivity. This not only lets you stream your music, but lets Sonos speakers easily communicate with each other and act as a multi-speaker system. When using Wi-Fi, you can also use voice assistants like Amazon Alexa.</p><p>On the other hand, unlike most other Sonos speakers, the Move supports Bluetooth connectivity. This means you can use Wi-Fi at home and the Move acts like a traditional Sonos speaker, but you can also take it on the move and treat it like a Bluetooth speaker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the Sonos Move is weather-resistant, it's not quite as tough as some of the other speakers we're looking at. It has an IP56 rating, and Sonos says it can withstand exposure to humidity, rain, snow, dust, and extreme temperatures. On the other hand, most of the other speakers we're looking at have a higher IP67 rating.</p><p>The Sonos Move offers up to 11 hours of playtime on a single charge. When it comes time to power it back up, you've got two options. A USB-C port makes for easy charging while you're on the move, but Sonos includes a charging base that you can place the speaker on when you're at home.</p><p>The Sonos Move comes in <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Black</a> and <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">White</a> color options. As Sonos is synonymous with multiroom audio, you can also buy the Move in a <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">two-room set</a> or a <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">four-room set</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/31-8djkxd9l-_sl500_-10.jpg> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>Sonos Move</h5><span>Best Portable Speaker Overall</span>$280 <span class=regular-price>$399</span> Save $119<p class=display-card-description>The Sonos Move combines the convenience and sound of a standard Sonos speaker with everything you'd expect from a Bluetooth speaker.

Despite the small size, Doss managed to fit a pair of drivers into the speaker, powered by a 12-watt <a href=#>class D amplifier</a>.</p><p>The SoundBox Touch is IPX4-rated water-resistant, which means it can withstand a few splashes, but you want to avoid dunking it in water. Fortunately, the capacitive touch controls mean there are far fewer points where water can get inside the speaker.</p><p>The SoundBox Touch's lithium-ion battery can keep the music playing for up to 20 hours, assuming you're listening at 50 percent volume. You can fully recharge the speaker in three to four hours by plugging into the micro USB port.</p><p>If you like colorful speakers, Doss has plenty of options for you.

Some portable models like the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">JBL Charge 5</a> function as the Swiss Army knife of the speaker world, which is why the speaker ended up as our favorite on our list of the <a href=#>best Bluetooth speakers</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Charge 5 doesn't focus on stereo out of a single speaker but instead uses a racetrack-shaped driver, a separate tweeter, and dual bass radiators to deliver big sound. Some portable speakers start to distort at higher volumes, but you don't have to worry about that with the Charge 5.</p><p>For stereo, JBL offers the PartyBoost feature. This lets you pair two or more PartyBoost-compatible speakers. You can link two for stereo sound, or add multiple speakers to provide ample volume and coverage for music in an outdoor party setting.</p><p>The JBL Charge 5 is IP67-rated waterproof and dustproof so you can take it anywhere. With up to 20 hours of battery life, you can ensure that you won't need to charge the speaker too often.

This is great for parties, as regardless of where people are, they can hear the music like they're standing in front of the speaker. With 20 hours of playtime, you can keep the party going for a while.</p><p>If that party happens to be near a pool, the Megaboom 3 really comes into its element. Not only is the speaker IP67-rated water-resistant, but it can withstand being submerged in one meter of water for up to 30 minutes. This shouldn't ever come into play, however, as the speaker also floats.</p><p>The Ultimate Ears Megaboom 3 features an extended range compared to most Bluetooth speakers. The maximum range here is 131 feet or 40 meters. That's impressive, but keep in mind that walls and other structures between you and the speaker will reduce the overall range.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're looking for stereo sound, the Megaboom 3 can pair with another Megaboom 3 for true stereo.
