But Gillian, 55, placed them front and center with her strapless ivory ballgown on Sunday night. Designed by Gabriela Heart, the voluminous skirt was patterned with countless vagina-inspired embroidery, each of which took three-and-a-half hours to sew.</p><p>“[I wore it] for so many reasons. It’s brand appropriate,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Deadline. Anderson is the founder of G Spot, a natural soft drinks company. The outlet also claims it was “a way of protesting restrictions to female rights.”</p><p>Talking to Extra TV, Gillian added: “There are so many yonis on my dress! I invited a [camera] pan to my yonis.” A total of 150 hours were spent embroidering, meaning about 42 vulvas decorated her skirt. The look was completed with Chopard jewelry and a chrome Aquazzura handbag.</p><p>Take a look at her yonis up close and personal:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1908168304-683x1024.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1908159775-1024x681.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-margot-robbie-revives-barbiecore-in-hot-pink-gown>Margot Robbie revives Barbiecore in hot pink gown</h2><p><a href=#>Margot Robbie</a> slayed the global <a href=#>Barbie</a> premieres with cleverly designed outfits inspired by the exact dolls in 2023. Even though the film hype is over, Barbiecore isn’t over until Margot says it is.</p><p>The 33-year-old Oscar nominee channeled 1977’s Superstar Barbie in a sequinned hot pink Armani dress with a V-neckline and a matching tulle boa.</p><p>Although the fashion ode was fit for a winner, Margot was defeated by <a href=#>Emma Stone</a> in the Best Female Actor category for Poor Things. Barbie received the most nominations with nine – including Best Motion Picture and Best Supporting Actor for Ryan Gosling – but only managed to scoop the inaugural Cinematic and Box-Office Achievement Honor. As the top-grossing film of 2023, the nostalgic film garnered $1.44 billion globally.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2WFcLPOpZuepl2cubCuxKxkoKGcobaiuoyapZ2doqi8r7%2BMnameq6NixKrAx2Zra2WmlrSqusCsZKOto6l6uLvNZpiwmaKZerS0zrBkn5mjnbawuo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
