Lee and Maren (Taylor Russell) are teenage cannibals on a road trip. They’re definitely murdering people, but you sympathize with them anyway. I think a lot of that has to do with the costume design. The hot cannibal wardrobe is, to my eye, really appealing—and it gives them both an unmistakable vulnerability.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I’ll be honest. I wanted to see Bones and All because of the fashion—not what the characters wear in the teaser photos, but what Taylor Russell wore on the press tour: vintage Vivienne Westwood<u>,</u> archival Ralph Lauren, and haute couture Schiaparelli. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/models/a41614830/taylor-russell-bones-and-all-press-tour-outfits/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Her film festival looks" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Her film festival looks</a> captivated me to the point where I watched <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjMt1MIk2EA" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the trailer on a loop" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>the trailer on a loop</u></a>—and it wasn’t until my fourth rewatch that I even realized the protagonists of the film ate human flesh.</p><img alt="bones and all" title="bones and all" width=2700 height=1800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bones-and-all-blvdr-2021-06-04-0008-r-rgb-1-1670837216.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Yannis Drakoulidis / Metro Goldwyn Mayer Pictures</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I went into the theater with almost no information about the story. All I knew for certain was that people kept using the following words to describe it: Tender. Beautiful. Heart-wrenching. Romantic. No one really mentioned all the gore. But 10 minutes into the film, I started to understand when Maren bit off her friend’s ring finger at a sleepover, then broke down into remorseful tears. These aren’t cannibals in the way Hannibal Lecter is; they don’t want to have this urge. And apparently, cannibals who don’t really want to be cannibals wear soft grunge.</p><img alt="bones and all" title="bones and all" width=3240 height=2160 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bones-and-all-blvdr-2021-06-15-0009-r-rgb-1670837273.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Yannis Drakoulidis / Metro Goldwyn Mayer Pictures</span></p><p>The wardrobe of loose floral dresses, slouchy T-shirts, and shredded denim feels slightly out of place for the 1980s, which is when the film is set. But costume designer Giulia Piersanti is sending a message by not dressing Lee and Marin in the bold colors, parachute pants, or puffed shoulders that were mainstream at the time. It’s clear they’re the kind of misfits who were the originators of the grunge aesthetic, before it became commodified by people who could afford non-ripped denim, but wanted to dress like they couldn’t. It all feels authentic on Maren and Lee, a chosen family of two, rejected by everyone close to them, with barely any money to their name. If the film wanted to set us up to hate them, it wouldn’t have put them in such pretty clothing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Piersanti has made pretty costumes for Bones and All’s director, Luca Guadagnino, before, notably in Call Me by Your Name and Suspiria. For the latter, Piersanti designed a custom print for a dress inspired by a Louise Bourgeois drawing of scattered women’s hip bones. From afar, it looked like simple gold embroidery of cherry-tree branches.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That quiet creepiness is evident in Bones and All’s costumes, too: The raw edges and pastel florals of Lee’s button-downs suggest maybe they used to be a meal’s old dress he reworked into a top. But he isn’t wearing them like trophies. Instead, there’s a softness and ease to his looks and Maren’s, reminiscent of those worn by the characters in Call Me by Your Name. Everything Elio and Oliver and Maren and Lee wear feels tender in a way that feels a little sad, like they each picked out these little denim shorts and chunky patterned sweaters to dress up for someone else when they can’t even look at themselves.</p><img alt="bones and all" title="bones and all" width=2700 height=1800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bones-and-all-blvdr-2021-06-18-0023-rc-rgb-1670837320.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Yannis Drakoulidis / Metro Goldwyn Mayer Pictures</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At a diner shortly after meeting (where, thankfully, they opt for pancakes and cereal), Lee tells Maren he doesn’t mind her hanging around him because she “seems nice,” to which she replies, “I am nice.” Lee “eats,” as he calls it, only when he feels like his meal had it coming. Maren, by contrast, acts impulsively, actively avoiding situations that will make her want to eat. At one point, she even puts the burden of finding a meal entirely on Lee so she can remove herself from the guilt she feels after.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Maren and Lee don’t identify with their cursed compulsion. They don’t see themselves as pretty young monsters like the audience does. And instead of someone like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/a42137976/white-lotus-portia-style/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Portia on The White Lotus" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Portia on The White Lotus</a>, who dresses like she doesn’t know who she is or who she wants to be, Maren and Lee dress like two people with an acute, aching sense of self. They know who they are. But that doesn’t stop them from trying to look like somebody else.</p><img alt="bones and all" title="bones and all" width=2700 height=1800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bones-and-all-blvdr-2021-06-05-0013-r-rgb-1670837349.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Yannis Drakoulidis / Metro Goldwyn Mayer Pictures</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The wardrobe makes it clear they’re searching for a sense of normalcy, but it also feels strange to say they don’t dress like cannibals, because what should a cannibal dress like? Other monsters portrayed in cinema have a fixed aesthetic, like eternally young vampires dressed in sexy black lace dresses and sleek leather jackets. Cannibals don’t, because they’re not entirely mythical. The most chilling thing about this kind of behavior is that it has actually existed, and like all the evil humans are capable of, it doesn’t come with a set costume.<br></p><img alt="bones and all" title="bones and all" width=2700 height=1800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bones-and-all-blvdr-2021-06-16-0012-r-rgb-1670837385.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Yannis Drakoulidis / Metro Goldwyn Mayer Pictures</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But Bones and All isn’t necessarily making a point about cannibalism so much as crafting an allegory. By dressing Maren and Lee in the kind of grunge uniform that has become the universal wardrobe of the romantically depressed and sensitive, Piersanti sets us up to view them as people first. Their struggles with self-acceptance make it clear that all the agony over flesh-eating is really just a metaphor for being an outsider, with outsider desires. Some have suggested it’s specifically about queerness; others have said Lee’s aesthetic feels so analogous to Kurt Cobain’s that it must be about addiction. But it could just as easily be viewed through the lens of anything deemed unacceptable by society (which, in the conformist ’80s, was a long, long list).</p><p>The grunge look has been romanticized for years, and it’s often thrown on characters to make them look edgy. But in Bones and All, it feels genuine, because it’s worn by tormented people who are filled with self-loathing but still yearn for self-knowledge. In the final 10 minutes of the film, Lee asks Maren, “Do you think I’m a bad person?” It’s clear they see themselves in each other, and so she can’t give him the answer he wants. But seeing him in his pink patterned top, with his blank, teary eyes, it doesn’t feel out of the realm of possibility to think maybe, somehow, he isn’t all bad either.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
