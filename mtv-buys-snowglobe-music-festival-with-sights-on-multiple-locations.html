(CelebrityAccess) MTV has announced the acquisition of New Year’s Eve event SnowGlobe Music Festival in South Lake Tahoe, Calif.</p><p>The annual, three-day event, founded by Chad Donnelly, takes place Dec. 29-31. Donnelly began building the SnowBall festival as a winter event in Colorado before creating Tahoe’s EDM fest in 2010. It recently announced this year’s lineup to include Above & Beyond, Diplo, Eric Prydz and RL Gryme.</p><p>The festival draws approximately 20,000 fans each day to its musical performances, live action sports, and interactive art exhibitions.</p><p>Artists from Kendrick Lamar to Post Malone to Zedd have performed at SnowGlobe.</p><p>Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p><p>“With SnowGlobe, MTV is taking the natural next step in its resurgence by expanding deeper into live events, as we continue to reach our fans and capitalize on our strong brand in new ways,” said Chris McCarthy, President of MTV, VH1, CMT, and Logo. “In a festival space where many events have become indistinguishable, SnowGlobe stands out with a unique mix of music, sports, and art that makes it a favorite among artists and its growing audience.”</p><p>“With SnowGlobe, we’ve always endeavored to create an event experience that sets itself apart from the typical music festival model,” said Donnelly. “We are incredibly excited to be joining the MTV family, whose legacy of developing boundary breaking programming and events perfectly aligns with our long-standing ambition of creative innovation.”</p><p>SnowGlobe will also feature all-new art installations and the festival’s “Big Air” activation showcasing extreme winter sports demonstrations.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrityaccess.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/PrimaryLogo_Snowglobe_Black-300x64.jpg alt width=764 height=163 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>MTV, in collaboration with the SnowGlobe team, plans to expand SnowGlobe to additional dates and locations worldwide and leverage its team to launch other new events as well, according to a statement.</p><p>SnowGlobe will also be a platform for MTV to reinvent its New Year’s Eve coverage, serving as the centerpiece for multiplatform programming and connecting live with the action at MTV’s Times Square studio. SnowGlobe joins MTV’s portfolio of international events, which attract more than a half-million attendees each year, according to MTV.</p><p>MTV currently leads all cable networks in ratings growth, according to the channel, its longest streak of growth in seven years. In June, MTV launched MTV Studios, which develops original series for SVOD and premium partners and recently announced a global reimagination of MTV’s Real World for Facebook Watch.</p><p>SnowGlobe’s three-day festival passes are available now and single day passes go on sale today.</p><p>SnowGlobe has featured acts including Childish Gambino, Tiesto, Disclosure, Flume, Snoop Dogg, Major Lazer, Post Malone, Odesza, The Chainsmokers, G-Eazy, Wiz Khalifa, Kaskade, Phantogram and many more.
