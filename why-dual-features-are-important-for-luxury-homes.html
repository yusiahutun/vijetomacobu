Luxury moves beyond what is necessary to what is desired because of its incredible craftsmanship, quality, function, rarity or reputation and comes at a price afforded only to those of higher economic means. To this vain, the newest trend in luxury homes is dual everything—the ultimate status symbol.</p><p>If one is good, then two must be even better, right? Yes, according to Stephanie Anton, president of Luxury Portfolio International (the largest global network of luxury real estate brokerages). <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luxury homes are now being built or redesigned</a> to improve comfort and function with many dual features. The focus has largely been on the kitchen and master bedroom. Included in this are dual dishwashers and refrigerators using <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">top-of-the-line products and dual islands</a>; one a dry station and one a wet station with a sink.</p><p>For the master bedroom, dual, large master closets that more closely resemble a boutique store than a walk-in are becoming the norm in luxury homes. Master bedroom suites will also include dual master baths, sometimes each complete with steam showers, deep soaker tubs and a gorgeous, peaceful view. In the extreme, many homes are now going the extra step of having complete dual master suites, giving each partner their own private enclave. These suites are often side-by-side and not to be confused with the additional master suite intended for guests that will appear in another area of the home.</p><p>This new trend to have dual features is at the heart of what luxury is: that which is afforded based on one’s wealth though not necessity.</p><p>To contact Nicole, call 772.763.8506 or email her at <strong><a href=#>nabertke@gmail.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZMC1wcCrq2akmZuycK3TZp%2BopZVkxKnFjJ2smqRdm7KiwNSrnKxlkaeybrXMqaarrJGjwW6yzqtkpa2oqr%2B6eceopJ6rXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
