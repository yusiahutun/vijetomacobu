This is Taylor Swift‚Äôs first worldwide theatrical release ‚Äî <a href=#>Miss Americana was only shown in select theaters</a> for a limited time before hitting Netflix ‚Äî and fans have already embraced the concert film almost as much as the sold-out tour itself. It broke presale records held by <a href=#>Star Wars</a> and Spider-Man, and movie theaters<strong> </strong>are<strong> </strong>anticipating a level of<strong> </strong>excitement similar to a Marvel movie.<strong> </strong>But Swifties are stuck in a <a href=#>lavender haze</a> of questions, trying to figure out if they can take the souvenir cups home or sing at the top of their lungs in a packed theater. Put on your sparkly boots and remember <a href=#>heartbreak is supposed to feel good</a> in a place like this, as we break down everything you need to know about seeing the Eras Tour movie.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnkft0b4000h3b70lvw86bby@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>How do I get a ticket if I haven‚Äôt already?</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnkftmvb000o3b704dfvhpnj@published data-word-count=47>While most opening night screenings are probably sold out, there are a few screenings with available tickets if you don‚Äôt mind sitting in the front row. Every AMC theater has at least four screenings per day during opening weekend, and most other theater chains are following suit.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnknvb1a000w3b80zot3drd2@published data-word-count=58>If you can‚Äôt make it opening weekend, AMC, Alamo Drafthouse, and Cinemark have tickets on sale through November 5 ‚Äî Regal has showings until November 9 in some areas. This gives you a chance to rewatch the concert over and over again. However, <a href=#>screenings</a> are only shown Thursday to Sunday to mimic the feeling of the in-person concert.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnjqczv6001b3b80kfn6i4k4@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Okay, I have my tickets.

As long as it is not disrupting other Swifties‚Äô enjoyment of the show. Alamo Drafthouse is encouraging fans to have fun while watching the movie. We‚Äôd recommend some arm dancing whilst sitting comfortably in your seat, as most theaters have rules about blocking emergency walkways or the view from other patrons. AMC specifically <a href=#>states</a>, ‚ÄúWe encourage dancing and singing throughout this concert film event, but please do not dance on our seats or block other guests from viewing, safely walking or exiting the auditorium.‚Äù And while some metalheads might disagree, singing does not equal screaming. The show is two hours and 45 minutes, not including trailers, and you‚Äôll need to preserve it for the full 10 minutes of ‚ÄúAll Too Well (Taylor‚Äôs Version).‚Äù</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnjqd1zd001k3b80ct11mclm@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>What about taking photos?</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnjqfnmq003g3b80464n2c8d@published data-word-count=42>You can take photos with your friends and their friendship bracelets before the show starts, but once Tay is on the screen, the phone goes away.

The material and/or color of the items may change depending on the theater, but the design is essentially the same. Regal has a pretty good deal for $19.89 (cute!). Fans who were scarred by <a href=#>the blue-crewneck saga</a> and <a href=#>the hours-long merch queue</a> at concerts may try to line up early to make sure they get their items, which isn‚Äôt a bad idea. There are free mini movie posters at select theaters like <a href=#>AMC</a>, Regal, and <a href=#>Cinemark</a> for ticket holders, a.k.a. another reason to get there early.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Regal (@regalmovies)</a></p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by AMC Theatres (@amctheatres)</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnjr3xjd009h3b80wvvi4dx7@published data-word-count=52>There is one theater that seems to have pulled out all the stops for merch, and it‚Äôs surprisingly not AMC, especially since it‚Äôs the one directly partnering with Swift for the movie.

The beginning of the era (right after ‚ÄúEnchanted‚Äù) includes a small dance number that‚Äôs a few minutes long, and if you time it right after Swift ends the Speak Now portion, you should make it back during the middle of ‚Äú22.‚Äù You could also leave during ‚ÄúAll Too Well (Ten Minute Version),‚Äù technically only missing one song.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clntou9sa000f3b7h6bj8xkgm@published data-word-count=23>If you need a break earlier (or just want to avoid crying in front of people), step out during ‚Äúmarjorie‚Äù or ‚Äúchampagne problems.‚Äù</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clntov6f2000j3b7ho8yn00bl@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Were songs cut from the film?</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clntovygw000o3b7hr3otv712@published data-word-count=106>Sorry, we‚Äôre about to break a perfectly good heart.

The ‚Äúseven‚Äù interlude in the folklore section was also removed from the theatrical version. But who‚Äôs to say Miss Swift won‚Äôt release an extended version on streaming in the future?

You won‚Äôt be on your own kid. For almost a year, Swifties have been making frequent trips to the craft store; Michaels saw a 300 percent increase in sales from jewelry-making supplies in cities where the Eras Tour stops were held. There are a few easy ways to get your bracelets ready for trading. The first is to have one arm as your ‚Äútrading‚Äù arm, filled with bracelets you‚Äôve made to trade with others or ones you‚Äôre retrading, and have the other arm to display the ones you‚Äôre keeping. Makes it easy to separate your own collection from the ones you plan to switch out. The second is to hold your trading bracelets on an old shower or carabiner ring, separating them by theme or album.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnjqg8ci006n3b8057lg6yw2@published data-word-count=94>If you‚Äôre stuck trying to figure out movie-related phrases for your bracelets, here are a few to get you started: ‚Äú<a href=#>If This Was a Movie</a>,‚Äù ‚Äú<a href=#>I can AMC you</a>,‚Äù ‚Äú<a href=#>flashback in a film reel,</a>‚Äù ‚Äú<a href=#>I Alamo-st Do</a>,‚Äù or ‚Äî&nbsp;if you‚Äôre feeling a little unhinged ‚Äî ‚Äú<a href=#>The Lorax</a>.‚Äù Simpler ones like ‚ÄúIn my movies era,‚Äù or ‚ÄúEras Tour,‚Äù or your favorite Swift songs would totally work too. However, if you don‚Äôt want to risk burning yourself with a <a href=#>hot-glue gun</a>, <a href=#>AMC</a> and Alamo Drafthouse have both been rumored to have some bracelets of their own.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnjqei3j002q3b807umwx7rb@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Anything else I should expect?</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnjqg0md005w3b80oypf55au@published data-word-count=11>A lot of singing, some crying, and definitely some hand hearts.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clntoxrlq000t3b7h02nudbs0@published data-word-count=11>This post has been updated since the release of the film.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clmy5b83000000pfblm18r6w3@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce: Complete Dating Rumor Timeline</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clm0w2ey800000pcuvsqb9eho@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Here Come the Eras Tour Concert Film Box Office</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cllz5h9rs004s0ia19hykiw12@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Taylor Swift Adds a Theater Near You to Eras Tour Stops</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>A Swiftie‚Äôs Guide to Seeing the Eras Tour Movie</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdhZXy1rdilpqtlo6y2p8CMnqmaq12pvLa%2BjKamr6GVYrS2tcOeZaGsnaE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
