This is because crypto is generally treated as property, meaning taxpayers can qualify a cryptocurrency donation as a tax-deductible charitable contribution.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Likewise, crypto crowdfunding enables entrepreneurs and organizations to take advantage of a greater pool of domestic and international donors who prefer donating via blockchain.</p><p>As more enterprises, startups, and individuals seek out blockchain solutions to secure funding, let's take a look at the seven leading crypto crowdfunding platforms available in the landscape today:</p><h2 id=gitcoin>1. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gitcoin</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/gitcoin.png><p>Kevin Owocki founded Gitcoin in the US in 2017. It has since evolved into one of the cryptocurrency ecosystem's most comprehensive solutions for open-source software development.</p><p>The platform operates as an on-demand space for developers to secure multiple forms of funding for their projects, including crypto crowdfunding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the features that Gitcoin possesses involve fundraising, tipping developers, hackathons, project search functions, and GitHub integrations.</p><p>Furthermore, the open-source space empowers developers to work on languages like Python, Rust, JavaScript, Ruby, HTML, CSS, Solidity, and Design. Gitcoin claims to have helped thousands of projects and teams grow their open-source ecosystems.</p><p>For investors, Gitcoin's suite of open-source projects means that there is a vast array of options to contribute to. Quarterly Gitcoin Grants rounds also allow direct investment into specific projects.</p><h2 id=quantmre>2. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">QuantmRE</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/quantmre.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Founded in 2017, QuantmRE is a crowdfunding platform that specializes in real estate. By allowing investors to build their own portfolio of assets based on micro-investing crypto in return for property equity, it's possible to combine cryptocurrency with the somewhat more stable property markets.</p><p>Furthermore, property owners can set themselves up to receive investment and gain additional value on their property by allowing cryptocurrency holders to invest in it. This is one ingenious way real estate holders can <a href=#>invest in cryptocurrencies without buying them</a>.</p><p>The process of crowdfunding equity is straightforward on the platform, too. Users simply need to register to see if they qualify, apply, and receive the funds.</p><h2 id=realblocks>3. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">RealBlocks</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/realblocks.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>RealBlocks was founded in the US in ​​2015 by Perrin Quarshie. Attracting interest from investment groups like Morgan Creek, Zelkova Ventures, and Crosslink Capital, RealBlocks has emerged as a leading decentralized crowdfunding platform.</p><p>RealBlocks is built on a decentralized model that features blockchain technology, enabling both institutional and retail investors alike to invest in real estate.</p><p>The process powering RealBlocks involves tokenizing physical assets, which breaks tangible goods down into component parts that can be bought piece by piece, with the potential for multiple investors to become involved.</p><p>RealBlocks is famed for its simplicity for users. Through the platform's simplified distribution channel, RealBlocks can raise more money through intermediaries and institutional channels.</p><p>Currently, RealBlocks services over 100 countries and has $77 billion under administration.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tallycoin>4. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tallycoin</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/tallycoin.png><p>Tallycoin is a simple crypto crowdfunding platform that offers easy, zero-fee donations to users with no requirement to register an account formally. Funding can be entirely anonymous and unfreezable so that investments go directly to their listed cause. All donations go directly to a crypto wallet under the user's control.</p><p>The great thing about Tallycoin is that it's entirely user-friendly and bills its setting up process to be akin to a simple website builder. Users simply list their cause, add their wallet information, and wait for secure donations to roll in.</p><p>And once you've got your crypto funds, it's best to keep them protected.

Its community-driven structure is an excellent way for donors to feel more intrinsically connected to the projects they believe in.</p><p>Although membership is required to begin investing, it allows causes to generate their own subscription models for revenue. This means a monthly fee is paid to access the platform's vast community, while donations are also liable for transaction fees.</p><p>The great thing about this platform is that it's simplified so that even non-crypto native users can create their own crowdfunding campaigns. The website is flexible and features Discord-style rooms that can help projects to better identify target audiences and to understand their needs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tecra-space>7. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tecra Space</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/tecra.png><p>Tecra Space takes a more traditional approach to crowdfunding. The decentralized space enables the listing of various projects stemming from patents, digital assets, and other intellectual property rights while having them broken down and tokenized.</p><p>The website makes it easy for developers to list their projects and offer varied timeframes for tokens and their buybacks. It's also possible for projects to be listed with different buy-in levels and perks for investors, such as access to a digital product or service, mentions or credits, or themed artworks, to name a few.</p><p>Projects listed on Tecra Space include video games, decentralized apps, mining operations, and renewable energy services, among others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's fairly straightforward to start raising funds.
