Tello Mobile may not have a celebrity spokesperson, but what it does have is very competitive pricing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-tello-mobile>What is Tello Mobile?</h2><p>Tello Mobile is a "<a href=#>Mobile Virtual Network Operator</a>" (MVNO) that offers low-cost wireless service to smartphone users in the U.S. An MVNO is a wireless carrier that doesn't own the network infrastructure it provides to customers.</p><p>In the case of Tello, like many MVNOs, it runs on T-Mobile's nationwide 4G LTE/5G network. Tello Mobile was founded in 2016 and was originally based on Sprint's network, but transitioned to T-Mobile after the carriers merged in 2020.</p><p>Tello lets you customize your own plan or choose from a list of pre-designed plans with unlimited talk, text, and data options. Tello also has no contracts, no fees, free hotspot and Wi-Fi calling, and free international calls to over 60 countries.</p><h2 id=prepaid-vs-postpaid-no-bill-surprises>Prepaid vs Postpaid: No Bill Surprises</h2><p>Unlike the major networks AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon, Tello is a "prepaid" service, which means you pay for a set amount of data, calls, and texts in advance. The previously mentioned carriers are "postpaid," which means you pay for what you used after the fact.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The benefit of a prepaid carrier is there are no surprises on your bill—you determine the monthly cost upfront. You can also change your plan at any time without any penalties or extra charges. Tello will even refund the unused balance of your old plan when you switch to a new one.</p><h2 id=how-does-tello-mobile-rsquo-s-lte-amp-5g-coverage-compare>How Does Tello Mobile’s LTE & 5G Coverage Compare?</h2><p>Tello Mobile uses the T-Mobile network, which the company claims covers 99% of Americans, and offers nationwide 4G LTE/5G coverage. Tello also supports Wi-Fi calling, which lets you make and receive calls over any Wi-Fi network, even if you have no cellular signal. This means you can stay connected in places where T-Mobile’s coverage might be weak or nonexistent, such as basements, rural areas, or inside buildings with thick walls.</p><p>If we look at coverage maps, T-Mobile is firmly in third place behind Verizon and AT&T for LTE coverage. However, T-Mobile does boast more 5G coverage than the other two carriers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/coverage-maps-lte.png> LTE coverage for AT&T (Blue), T-Mobile (Pink), and Verizon (Red) <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/coverage-maps-5g.png> 5G coverage for AT&T (Blue), T-Mobile (Pink), and Verizon (Red)<p>The one key thing to remember with MVNO carriers is something called "deprioritization." While Tello uses T-Mobile's network, its customers don't necessarily get the same priority as T-Mobile customers. This especially comes into play at crowded locations, such as sporting events or concerts. A Tello customer standing directly next to a T-Mobile customer may experience slower speeds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-does-tello-mobile-rsquo-s-pricing-compare>How Does Tello Mobile’s Pricing Compare?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tello Mobile’s plans</a> are some of the most competitive in the market, especially if you don’t need a lot of data. You have the option to either pick from a list of pre-designed "Popular" plans or build your own plan by adjusting the amount of data and talk time you get. Texting is free no matter what plan you choose.</p><p>Tello’s Popular plans range from $9 to $25 per month and include the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Economy</strong>: $9/month for unlimited talk and text, plus 1GB of data.</li><li><strong>Value</strong>: $10/month for unlimited talk and text, plus 2GB of data.</li><li><strong>Smart</strong>: $14/month for unlimited talk and text, plus 5GB of data.</li><li><strong>Unlimited</strong>: $25/month for unlimited talk, text, and data.</li></ul><p>Tello’s build-your-own plan option lets you customize your plan according to your needs. Simply choose a data and talk option (texts are always free).</p><ul><li><strong>Data</strong>: None, 1GB, 2GB, 5GB, 10GB, 15GB, or unlimited.</li><li><strong>Talk</strong>: None, 100 minutes, 300 minutes, 500 minutes, or unlimited.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The price of your plan will depend on the combination of data and talk time you select. For example, you can get a plan with 1GB of data and 100 minutes of talk for only $6 or a plan with 15GB of data and no talk for $20. The ability to opt for no data or no talk is great, especially for a device like a tablet.</p><p>In addition, all plans include:</p><ul><li><strong>Free international calls</strong>: You can make free calls to over 60 countries, including Canada, Mexico, China, and India, using your Tello plan. You can see the full list of countries and rates on their website.</li><li><strong>Free hotspot</strong>: You can use your phone as a hotspot and share your data with other devices at no extra cost. However, keep in mind that hotspot data counts towards your plan’s data limit, and hotspot speeds may be slower than on-device speeds.</li><li><strong>Family plans</strong>: You can add multiple lines to your Tello account and create a family plan with different plans for each member. You can also manage all your lines from one dashboard and pay with one bill. There is no extra cost for adding new lines.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plans from AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon are not as flexible as Tello, and generally cost much more.</p><p>AT&T's cheapest plan for one line is $50 per month for 4GB of data. T-Mobile's cheapest plan for one line is also $50 per month, but it's unlimited data. Verizon's cheapest plan for one line is $60 for unlimited data.</p><p>Like Tello, the three major carriers also offer prepaid plans.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim"> AT&T</a> offers 5GB for $30 per month, Unlimited for $65 per month, and Unlimited for $25 per month (if you pay for a year in advance). <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">T-Mobile</a> offers 10GB for $40 per month, Unlimited for $50 per month, and Unlimited + 10GB Hotspot for $60 per month. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Verizon</a> offers 15GB for $35 per month, Unlimited for $50 per month, and Unlimited + Hotspot for $60 per month.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-phones-does-tello-mobile-support>What Phones Does Tello Mobile Support?</h2><p>Tello Mobile supports most unlocked GSM phones that are compatible with the T-Mobile network. You can bring your own phone and keep your number, or you can buy a new phone from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tello’s online store</a>. Tello offers a variety of phones, from basic flip phones to flagship smartphones—including iPhones—at different price points. However, most of the phones offered by Tello are not the current generation models.</p><p>Tello Mobile is yet another great option in the world of MVNO carriers. <a href=#>Its closest competitor is Mint Mobile</a>, which gives customers discounts for prepaying for multiple months in advance. However, Tello is generally a bit cheaper across the board, and it's not directly owned by one of the major three carriers like <a href=#>Mint (T-Mobile)</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGirnqScpHquu8Gio55lpqh6osDTZq2eqpmvvK9502akqJqZobJw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
