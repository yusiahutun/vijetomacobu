They have sent money to NEST Café, Project NOW, two animal shelters, the Rock Island police and fire departments, and others.&nbsp;</p><p>“During COVID, we were blessed enough to have never shut down,” Steve’s bartender Tammy Neeley said this week of starting a “Pay It Forward” campaign. They were closed inside for six months in 2020 but offered curbside pickup, which kept regular customers happy, she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/01/Steves2.jpg><p>“We just decided because so many other small businesses didn’t make it, we’re going to try and pay it forward to other people in need,” Neeley said. “We’ve done so many.”</p><p>That didn’t take away from the business bottom line, since bartenders would donate tips and many regulars put in a dollar or a two every day, she said.</p><p>“That adds up very quickly. We felt, because we were so blessed, that was the right thing to do,” she added.</p><p>After Steve’s reopened in late 2020, business was solid and they didn’t lose any employees, Neeley said, noting they have six staff.</p><p>David Smith, a former longtime co-owner at Blue Cat Brew Pub (his wife Martha Cleaveland was co-founder of that downtown Rock Island mainstay), is a regular at Steve’s.</p><p>“Everybody just started opening up their pockets,” he said. “You put the jar down there. I pay for my coffee and this goes in the jar. The regulars are down here too. Everybody just kicks in and we choose a different place, it’s just what we do.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2022/07/Nest2.png><p>They averaged giving a check about once a month, helping a dozen organizations so far. NEST Café, because it was new, they got $200. “Everybody’s been so generous,” Neeley said. “We’re gonna keep doing it.”</p><p>Steve’s is “a good townie bar,” Smith said. “You have a union plumber, sitting next to an accountant, sitting next to a City Council member. It’s a good Rock Island bar. And you have people from the hotel (Holiday Inn across the street) stopping by, too.”</p><p>“I basically open up my wallet. We all love doing it,” he said.</p><p>“It doesn’t take a lot to make somebody’s day,” said another 40-year Steve’s regular, who declined to give his name. “Tammy is a great front person for it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaJ6eppWnvLa%2FjKumnKNdnsCtrc2dZJuZomK9osXSZqCtZZakv7it0Z1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
