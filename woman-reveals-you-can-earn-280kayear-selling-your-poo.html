Sign me up,” exclaimed another of potentially heeding nature’s call for cash.</p><p>But don’t be lured by the idea of a gastrointestinal gold rush just yet: Becoming a dung donator involves more than the ability to go No. 2.</p><p>According to Human Microbes, prospective poop donors must be in the “tiny 0.1 per cent of people who are still healthy enough to qualify as a high-quality stool donor,” per the site.</p><p>This means being in “exceptional physical and mental health” — top athletes are best — and under 30, although there is no minimum age requirement.</p><p>Minimal antibiotic usage is also a must, so you don’t upset the balance of the faecal system.</p><p>The selective criteria certainly mean most applications will go down the toilet.</p><p>In fact, despite screening 26,000 potential donors, Human Microbes still hasn’t found the supply of high-quality donors they’re looking for — hence the $500 ($AU780)</p><p>per poop financial incentive.</p><p>The requirements may seem stringent, however, Human Microbes says selectiveness is essential given deteriorating health levels nationwide.</p><p>“Chronic disease and general poor health have been drastically increasing over the past decades to the point where the vast majority of the population is now extremely unhealthy,” they write.</p><p>“It goes well beyond a single generation being a little overweight due to eating too much.”</p><p>They add: “It is an exponentially worsening crisis with each generation, in large part due to the loss of our host-native microbes that get passed down generationally.”</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>The Australian Centre for Digestive Diseases did a call out for faeces donors in 2018, offering $50 for each delivery — meaning you could make as much as $250 a week — which equated to an impressive $13,000 a year.</p><p>Just like the US system, Australia has a shortage of donors, and participants have to face the same rigorous qualifying process.</p><p><i>This article originally appeared on <a class=body-link href=# title=nypost.com>The New York Post</a> and was reproduced with permission</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme9GemKVlnJ6zpnvNnq6sZZyes6Z71qikmqZdp7K3scClqmaxn6p6pK3NZpyaqp5if3l8ypqwnpmiYsCmuMuipaBlqaTCs3nPqKZoppWswG6%2F06ipsmdoaa94gZWfaW6ZYmaEpoXBapqca2WWgHODk5qbcnCWaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
