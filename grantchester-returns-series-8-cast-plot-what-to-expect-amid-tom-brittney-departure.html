What drives him in life is being the best man he can – everything he does, every case he helps Geordie with, every problem that he solves, he feels like he's getting better and better as a person, morally. And then this thing happens that just seems to erase all of that in one instant. Everything he’s worked so hard for is gone just like that.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/24ef51f447e4-tom-brittney-s8-grantchester.jpg><p id=eL5G6_iBVh4 data-wc=45>"It just destroys the way Will thinks of himself, because this action, whether it was an accident or on purpose, in the eyes of God and everyone else, he believes it’s unforgivable, and it really sets him down a dark path," the actor told ITV.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Who's starring in the new series?&nbsp;</h2><p id=eetwfG6NiMM data-wc=52>As usual, Tom Brittney and Robson Green will lead the cast as Will and Geordie.
