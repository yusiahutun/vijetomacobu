While Rome wasn’t built in a day, you may be pleasantly surprised by all you’ll be able to accomplish across the next 365 days. With Mars—your ruling planet—entering your third house of communication on January 3, you’ll be able to sweet talk your way through all your New Year’s resolutions.</p><p>You’ve already begun the process of healing some of your childhood trauma, because you got a taste of Pluto in Aquarius during 2023. However, <a href=#>Pluto will </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">re</a><a href=#>-enter Aquarius</a> from January 20 to September 1, and again on November 19, where it will continue to transform your fourth house of home and family until 2043. During this time, you may feel like a tree that has been picked up by its roots, only to be replanted somewhere else. And while this could leave you feeling insecure and unsure at times, it will ultimately allow you to grow taller than you ever thought possible. This year, you may begin the process of moving, healing, building, and reconnecting with family in a meaningful new way.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/newmoonintauruszodiac.gif?w=960&h=540&crop=1"><p>If you’ve been putting too much pressure on yourself to keep up with productivity at the expense of your health and well-being, <a href=# id=auto-tag_2024 data-tag=2024>2024</a> will be the year you heal that misbelief. On February 19, <a href=#>the North </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Node</a><a href=#> of Destiny</a> will join forces with Chiron—the wounded healer—in your sixth house of work and health, prompting you to forge rituals and routines that benefit you rather than deplete you. Once a lunar eclipse in Libra provokes change in your 12th house of spirituality on March 25, you will face your demons right before you set yourself free from guilt, resentment, and anything that holds you back. However, a total solar eclipse in Aries on April 8 will snap you right back into reality, as it will kickstart a new beginning in your sixth house of work, health, daily routine. Allow this eclipse to help you become more grounded, helping you forge rituals that refine and improve your life on a physical level.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lovehoroscopefeb2023.png><p>By spring, you may begin the process of strengthening your relationships and solidifying them in solid gold. As <a href=#>Jupiter joins forces</a><a href=#>with Uranus</a> in your seventh house of partnerships on April 20, you may start a relationship with someone new that has the power to take both of you to incredible new heights. Whether these relationships are platonic, romantic, or even business-oriented, you have the power to truly pioneer something game-changing together. And once Jupiter enters Gemini on May 25, it will sprinkle fairy dust on your eighth house of merging energies, which will expand your desire for trust, investment, and shared connection. You’re no longer in the mood for superficial promises, but something much deeper and weightier. You’re also in a beautiful position to make wise decisions with your money, so make sure you meet with a financial advisor.</p><p>By autumn, you may be starting new love affairs and letting go of pain from your past. A lunar eclipse in Pisces lights a fire in your fifth house of romance and self-expression on September 17, which could lead to creations of all kinds. You may be reframing your understanding of love, connection, and creativity, so give in to the temptations that tug on your heartstrings. A subsequent <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>solar eclipse in Libra</a> will shed skin you’ve outgrown in your 12th house of spirituality and endings, allowing you to forgive yourself on all the levels you’ve been holding yourself back.</p><p>The most challenging part of the year begins on December 6, when <a href=#>Mars—your ruling </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">planet</a><a href=#>—stations retrograde</a> in your 10th house of career and public image. You may feel slighted by setbacks as you struggle to prove yourself during this time, so stop trying to. This retrograde is challenging you to know your worth without the rest of the world validating it. Instead of clashing with your superiors, give them time to realize all the hard work you’ve been doing on their own time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9mom6KZk2R%2Bd4STaW5rZ6OYvLO8yKhka2hiaXqpu9GoqpynoJp8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
