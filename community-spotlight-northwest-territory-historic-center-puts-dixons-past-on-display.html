Pretty much 99 percent of the kids that come in here are astounded by some of the things they see about the Black Hawk Wars.”&nbsp;</p><p>Latta has worked at the center for 14 years and the Black Hawk exhibit is still is favorite, but he said a highlight on the tour is always stopping by Reagan’s old classroom.&nbsp;</p><p>“The teachers will bring them in and they sit down in the seats and they think it’s just really something that they’re sitting where a president sat,” he said. “It’s pretty nice to see the smiles on their faces.”&nbsp;</p><p>In a time when people can be quick to forget the past, Latta said the Northwest Territory Historic Center reminds people to stop and look back.</p><p>“So many of these places that get torn down and you know they’re never thought of again and it’s history,” he said. “This is saving history right here.”&nbsp;</p><p>The Northwest Territory Center is open Tuesday-Saturday from 9 a.m.- 4 p.m. Admission is free, but donations are accepted.
