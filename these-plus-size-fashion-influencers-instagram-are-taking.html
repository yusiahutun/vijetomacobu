One of these is Berlin-based blogger Caterina Pogorzelski.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/01/07/35b0bb82-3038-11ea-9400-58350050ee52_972x_130704.jpg>With a blog called Megabambi, a podcast and Instagram account, 38-year-old Pogorzelski has built an entire brand from talking about her life as a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">plus-size woman</span></a> and posting images of herself in various outfits.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The most annoying cliché, she says, is that many people assume “every fat person eats chocolate all day, doesn’t do any exercise and doesn’t know how to eat healthily”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pogorzelski has no problem with calling herself fat – “That’s what I&nbsp;am, after all!”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But she is still in the minority in the German-speaking world, where only a handful of women are so outspoken about being plus-size. When she was growing up, Pogorzelski says, there was only one famous fat woman: a comedian.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She says her mother gave her a strong sense of self-confidence. “I have always been very conspicuous,” she says. She was discovered as a model at 20, and later attended acting school.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pogorzelski believes society is slowly changing and becoming more accepting of fat bodies. For example, TV channels are now more likely to show her whole body on screen, and she is more often asked to give on-air styling advice that doesn’t just apply to fat people.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Part of Pogorzelski’s brand is to accept oneself and one’s body. “Stand in front of the mirror. Look at yourself. Be honest with yourself. Find the parts of your body that you like, and then start with that. Find clothing that accentuates that part,” she advises.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The fashion industry, she believes, has some catching up to do: “Of course there’s clothing in larger sizes, but not enough.” Most items are either too cheap or too expensive, she says – the mid-range is lacking.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Simply addressing the issue of health on the basis of appearance is superficial and not thought throughPlus-size model Charlotte Kuhrt</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s not that fashion labels haven’t noticed the demand. But definitions of “plus-size” vary among manufacturers.</p>German e-commerce company Otto has a blog called “Soulfully” that’s aimed at <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">plus-size shoppers</span></a>. It publishes articles such as hairstyle tips for rounder faces and advice on winter jackets for XXL sizes, as well as pieces on psychological topics such as how to feel more accepted.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Doerte Lehne, head of the blog team, says the idea is to let the community speak. “These women don’t want to be a special target group,” she says. Through digitalisation, they have a chance to become visible and “the image of what a woman looks like has changed as a result”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But with more visibility online come more trolls from the internet’s bottom layers. Obesity is a problem and not an achievement, argued a recent article from the opinion pages of national newspaper Die Welt.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Plus-size model Charlotte Kuhrt hit back in an interview with the blog “This is Jane Wayne” that she didn’t know any plus-size models who were telling people that they should become fat and unhealthy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Simply addressing the issue of health on the basis of appearance is superficial and not thought through,” Kuhrt told the blog.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Claus Fleissner is one of the male voices in the plus-size fashion world. “Even when we’re fat, we still want to be fashionable,” says the 41-year-old social media manager from Frankfurt.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“All bodies have their place,” he believes. By taking a positive look at his own body, he’s seeing a slow change in how society thinks as well. In that aspect, women have a pioneering role, he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His fashion tip? Do what you want and don’t listen to advice that forbids you from wearing certain items, such as that horizontal stripes make you look fat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I love stripes!” he says.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: How plus-size influencers are expanding the Instagram look</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlkpqutsDYaJirrJmYuaZ7kmlrbXFmZ3y1tMSsnGaonKrAbr%2FIs5xmnpGotaq7zWagp56cqrKvr8SrqmahnqjBorPRmqRmmaKaerWtyqKloA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
