Although you can easily change your location on an Android phone with some third-party apps, this isn't the case on an iPhone or iPad.</p><p>But what if we told you that you could do it on your iPhone and iPad as well? That's right! The iToolab AnyGo app lets you do the same with ease.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=what-is-itoolab-anygo><strong>What Is iToolab AnyGo?</strong></h2><p><a href=#>iToolab AnyGo</a> is a location spoofing application that changes GPS location on your iPhone or iPad, so it appears to be in a different location. You can use it on devices running Windows 10/8.1/8/7 and macOS 10.10 and higher to change the iPhone's or iPad's GPS location.</p><p>The app is available across all platforms and offers a lot of features. Here are some of them.</p><ul><li>Spoof your GPS location to anywhere in the world.</li><li>Simulate a GPS movement along any custom path.</li><li>Natural-walking speed.</li><li>Change Multiple iPhone Locations simultaneously.</li><li>Import GPX route file for a custom path.</li><li>Works best with LBS (Location Based Service) apps like Tinder, Pokémon GO, Bumble, Life360, etc.</li></ul><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=why-should-you-use-anygo><strong>Why Should You Use AnyGo?</strong></h2><p>AnyGo is best-suited for those who use apps like Tinder, Bumble, or any other location-based service apps. But if you're a Pokémon GO player, then it's a blessing for you. You can catch Pokémon specific to a region from the comfort of your own home.</p><p>You can also switch locations when you don't want your friends to know your location through apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp, or other location-based services. Perhaps you can make some of your friends envious of your travels.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/multiple-modes-anygo.png><p>The best part about spoofing your location is that you can access geo-restricted content from the comfort of your home. This comes in handy when you want to watch a movie or TV show, which isn't available in your region for some reason.</p><p>If it's dating, you can unlock a whole new world of opportunities when you spoof your location with AnyGo iPhone location spoofer. You can go across town, to a new city, or even to a different country to find your companion.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>So, it's a superb choice if you use a lot of location-based apps and want to explore different locations. You can keep track of the history of past routes, so you don't miss any in the future.</p><p>Using AnyGo is surprisingly easy compared to other GPS spoofing apps. You can <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">change location without jailbreak</a> on both iPhone and iPad to fake a GPS location. Furthermore, you can also move around 360 degrees on a set GPS spot by using your keyboard's WASD or arrow keys.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>You can connect as many iPhones or iPads as you like and change their locations simultaneously.</p><h2 id=how-does-itoolab-anygo-work>How Does iToolab AnyGo Work?</h2><p>As an example of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">how AnyGo works</a>, we'll look at two scenarios where you can see how it works in real life.</p><h3 id=teleport-to-any-location-in-the-world>Teleport to Any Location in the World</h3><p>You can change your location to any part of the world. You just need to download the software and follow the instructions below.</p><li><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Download and install AnyGo</a> on your Mac or Windows. <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AnyGo-desktop-app-startup-screen.png></li><li>Connect your iPhone to your computer and select the Start button.

All apps that use your location would share the same fake GPS location on iPhone.</p><h3 id=simulate-movement-along-a-specified-route>Simulate Movement Along a Specified Route</h3><p>You can simulate a specified path to spoof your location and make it more believable to apps like Pokémon GO and others.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Simulating a specific route using AnyGo is simpler than you think. Here's how you can do it.</p><li><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Open AnyGo</a> and connect your iPhone to your computer.</li><li>Click on the Start button on the app's homepage. <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AnyGo-desktop-app-startup-screen.png></li><li>Select the Two-Spot Route icon on the top-right.</li><li>Search and select the place where you want to go on the map. A pop-up will show you the distance between the two locations. <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AnyGo-app-pricing.png></li><li>You can choose Realistic mode for variable movement. Besides that, you can drag the slider at the bottom to adjust the speed of your movement.</li><li>Select how many times you want to loop between the two spots, and the way you want it to happen. <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></li><li>Once done, select the Go option to simulate your movement between two spots.</li><p>AnyGo uses a desktop tool, since Apple doesn't allow GPS apps to spoof iPhone or iPad location. So, the best way to do it is to use a desktop tool.</p><h2 id=itoolab-39-s-anygo-pricing>iToolab's AnyGo Pricing</h2><p>Now that you know the features of iToolab's AnyGo, you should give it a try.
