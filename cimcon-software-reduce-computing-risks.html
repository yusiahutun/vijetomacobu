It is when you look at the end-user experience holistically that you consider all the systems required to complete the daily workload. How end-user computing comes into the picture is when instead of building an individual Point of Delivery for each desktop type, application, and database, you combine all of these systems into a single platform which will ultimately help you deliver an even more efficient user experience.</p><p>Established in 1988, CIMCON Software, LLC pioneered and remains the leader in end-user computing risk management.

Further, several high-profile incidents related to spreadsheet errors that resulted in billions of losses at major financial service companies helped companies realize how risky spreadsheets could be. Hence, regulations like these as well as the daily drumbeat of companies losing millions due to spreadsheet errors and fraud helped to create a market for their products.</p><p>Apart from that, the one factor that has helped the company sustain through the hard times is its dedication and constant innovation. Based on the needs of the market, CIMCON Software has been innovating its services continuously. Second is listening to customers and paying close attention to their problems, issues and pain points.&nbsp;</p><p>We provide excellent customer service and strive to exceed their expectations.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Products and Services-</h3><p>CIMCON Software provides <a href=#>risk management products</a> in the area of End User Computing (EUCs).&nbsp; EUCs are areas where users have wide latitude in developing software applications without the traditional IT controls such as source code control, version control, and formal testing.&nbsp; These mostly include spreadsheets but can also include Access databases and SQL/other code scripts.&nbsp;</p><p>CIMCON Software offers a single integrated platform called EUC Insight to manage risks through the entire life cycle.&nbsp; These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Discovery Module</strong>:&nbsp; Scans the shared drives and other EUC repositories to help gain an understanding of the EUC landscape, perform automated risk assessments and data categorization, and view lineage/data flows at an enterprise level.</li><li><strong>Inventory Module</strong>:&nbsp; Maintains an inventory of high risk EUCs and models, with fields such as Author, Owner, Business Process, and other customizable fields.</li><li><strong>Change Management Module</strong>: &nbsp;&nbsp;Automated monitoring of files with cell level audit trails, review and approval workflow, and detection of high risk changes.</li><li><strong>XLAudit:</strong> &nbsp;A plug-in to Excel and an end-user tool to quickly find errors with a highly visual, color coded method. &nbsp;Generates documentation and validates EUCs.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Their other services include-</h3><ul><li><strong>ACCESS TO SQL MIGRATION</strong>– CIMCON Software can migrate your legacy Access databases to a Cloud or on-premise SQL Server back end and a web-based front end.

This give a very good idea of not only how customers are using their products, but also what are the additional use cases or other requirements that it can fulfill, and then that drives the product enhancements and roadmap.</p><p>There are several exciting things that the company is working on. For example, the transition to Cloud is now happening at a much faster pace than before. So the company is working on enhancing its current Cloud-based products and services. Further, customers are looking to automate more and more of the business process without manual intervention, so they are also looking to enhance this even more.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Sanjay Agrawal- The Entrepreneur-</h3><p>Mr. Sanjay initially worked for 4 years as a compliance consultant out of college, and realized that compliance was very manual, error-prone and an expensive process for most companies. He then founded CIMCON Software to develop easy, automated tools that can help companies become more productive and achieve compliance at the same time.</p><p>The biggest achievement of his entrepreneurial journey, Mr. Sanjay says has been that he started with an idea and then grew the company into becoming the market leader in its segment. Along with way, we pioneered many new methodologies and modules, developed a client base of some of the most admired and recognizable names in the industry, and won many accolades from leading market analysts, including a #1 ranking from Gartner as well as #1 rankings in independent customer surveys for 3 consecutive years.</p><p>This is what he has to say about “Entrepreneurship”:</p><p>The reward of Entrepreneurship is to be able to pursue your own passions.</p>Sanjay Agrawal<p>There are many stakeholders and you must keep everyone happy.&nbsp; This includes your employees, customers, and shareholders.&nbsp; All are interrelated and you cannot do any one without the other.&nbsp; You need to do this at all stages of the company.&nbsp; You must listen carefully, monitor trends, anticipate changes, and continually adapt as needed.&nbsp;</p><p>“Innovation is the key to success and growth.”</p><p>These are normally large financial service companies and often have unique needs for example to integrate with other existing systems.&nbsp; With CIMCON’S large R&D team, the company was able to go the extra mile, be very responsive to their needs, and often exceed their expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>The Enterprise World has always been keen on finding that one thing that pushes the entrepreneurs to their limits, a book they read which inspired them to start something, some specific part of the book that is close to their hearts, anything that keeps them motivated. This especially helps the budding entrepreneurs get a perspective of what they are doing.</p><p>Here is what Mr. Sanjay replied and surely you can give it a go and find something that might inspire you!</p><p>The biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson is of course a classic must-read not only for entrepreneurs but for anyone in the technology industry.&nbsp; I also like “The Innovator’s Dilemma” by Clayton Christensen.&nbsp; Christensen coined the term “disruptive innovation”, and explains in the book how new technologies can cause otherwise great firms who do everything else right to fail, and how firms can look for signs of innovation that can turn into major threats.</p><p>And the person he finds the most inspiring.</p><p>Elon Musk.&nbsp; He has taken on big problems that we face as a planet i.e. climate change and addressed them on a very large scale.&nbsp; I admire his vision, what he chose to do, his courage to take on established industry players, and his execution.&nbsp; It is very rare to have all of these.</p><p>And his one last favorite quote?&nbsp; Mr. Sanjay says everything begins and ends with the right mindset and attitude.&nbsp; This one thing can help you attain great heights or it can limit your potential.</p><p>If you think you can or you can’t, you are right.</p>Henry Ford<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZLCqucKopWarn5vBuK3RnmSrnZSqsKZ5wqikqa2knruoedGiqqSr</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
