Infact, he gave the word “obsession” a whole new meaning — following her, ruining her relationship, and even destroying her home.</span></p><p><span>But that’s all fantasy! What about the Irish actor’s real life? Is he married? Is he gay? Find answers as you scroll down.</span></p><h3><b>Colin Morgan Wife: Is The Irish Actor Married?</b></h3><p><span>Rumors had that Colin Morgan was engaged to be married to Katie McGrath! Some even believed that they were married in secret. But are these gossips true? To evaluate, let’s start with their history from the beginning.</span></p><p><span>Colin and Katie first met in 2008, over the first season of </span><i><span>Merlin</span></i><span>. Fast-forward to over five years of being co-stars, the two seemed closer than ever. During an interview with NewNowNext, Colin and Katie then everything from their characters to the final season coming out</span></p><p><span>“It’s a bit of a sad question for all of us. I think we all ended up with the same answers, but we’ll miss the people that we’re working with. I’ll miss Bradley and Colin and Angel and all the boys and then the crew as well, right down from pre-production up to post-production. It’s been five years and we’re a slightly dysfunctional family, but we’re a family, and I’m going to miss seeing them every day,”&nbsp; Katie said. And quickly agreed with her!</span></p><p><span>So, it’s clear that the two considered each other a “family” and shared a close-knit bond.</span></p><p><span>Thereafter, many sources started reporting that the pair were engaged and soon married in 2016.

This cleared things up.</span></p><p><span>But the co-stars were indeed partially to blame for letting the rumor escalate. The lack of clarity from them only encouraged people, especially their fans to speculate more and interpret their relationship the way they want.</span></p><p><span>“I just don’t know where the hell the media got all this so-called ‘information’ about their ‘relationship’. Celebs get enough hassle as it is, you know. I just feel bad for both of them, repeatedly being asked about it and having rumors made up about them for something like ten years,” a fan express their disapproval on Reddit.</span></p><h3><b>Is Morgan Gay?

Colin has also played a gay character “Benjamin” in a movie alongside Bradley James. The duo portrayed their characters so well that, fans started shipping them together. Then, the rumors caught the wind as the couple took a picture together, wearing a black tuxedo on the red carpet event.</span></p><p><span>Now, the truth remains that the two were no more than co-actors. Infact, they weren’t even that close for them to remain in contact after the filming ended. However, in March 2020, during an IG life, Bradley did confess that he wanted to rekindle the bond he used to have with to rekindle the bond they used to have together on the set. on the set.</span></p><h3><b>Colin Morgan Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>Colin Morgan flaunted a net worth of above $4 million in 2023.</span></p><p><span>This talented actor started his career in 2007 in several stage productions, including an adaptation of DBC Pierre’s</span><i><span> Vernon God Little</span></i><span>, and Pedro Almodóvar’s A</span><i><span>ll About My Mother </span></i><span>at London’s Old Vic theater.
