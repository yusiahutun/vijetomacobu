Their friendship quickly blossomed into something more, and when Gomez heard their rich harmonies while recording at the same studio, she knew she wanted them to join her on her 2016 Revival tour.</p><p>When the girls came in to our studio as <strong><a href=#>TooFab's TooGood Artist of the Month</a></strong>, we were lucky enough to hear those wonderful harmonies in person.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5732af3f-67c0-54ab-af86-c7b429d37d7d data-container-ref=toofab:article:cf9be186-cbe1-5116-a4b1-d41f88f0829c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ef/5by4/2018/06/12/ef2e38b1a2e05af0afdd351d94bed16b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Tony Naylor</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">How Hip-Hop Artist British Mendoza's Faith and Military Service Inspired Debut EP 'I.M.A.G.E.'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Sidney told TooFab that Selena would often "make jokes" about them going on tour with her. The girls said they didn't think much of it until they received that official email confirming them for the once-in-a-lifetime gig.</p><p>"It was really unreal. It all just happened so fast. I think all three of us can agree it was one of the best experiences of our whole entire lives," Ruby said of Bahari's time on the Revival tour. The girls also all agreed that Selena is "such a nice person" and "so down to earth."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/71/16by9/2018/07/31/71a9c04055da51c3b098f1db49733a01_md.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=visually-hidden>Play video content</span><p>"It's so amazing to see young female artists really supporting other young female artists," Ruby said.</p><p>"And she didn't have to support us," Natalia added. "She would post pictures of us just to help us out. We were like, 'Wow, thank you. We can't really return that. Sorry!'"</p><p>But Sidney, Natalia and Ruby have grown and matured since their younger "pop" days, which they said was the direction their label wanted them to go. At the end of last year, however, Bahari was dropped from Interscope Records -- an experience the girls now view as a "blessing in disguise."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:fb73db04-0c16-54fc-bddf-1886027db1de data-container-ref=toofab:article:cf9be186-cbe1-5116-a4b1-d41f88f0829c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5e/5by4/2018/05/24/5e0aac1f34f5527c9f6ecca75608cf54_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">TooFab</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">How the Goo Goo Dolls Helped Singer-Songwriter Lee Discover Their Gender Fluid Identity</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>With their newfound musical independence, Sidney, Natalia and Ruby are focusing all their energies on perfecting their ethereal/folksy sound, the eloquence of their lyrics, and the emotions they want their music to convey.</p><p>"We learned a lot and we had a lot of good experiences, but we also didn't really know how to stand up for certain things we wanted," Natalia said.</p><p>"We're also so lucky that we experienced so much, so young," Sidney added. "We were on a label before, and we were so blessed and so lucky to have that, but now we're on our own. We're fully independent, so we have that drive where we were on a label and now we're not, so we have to work way harder... It's terrifying, but it's also the best feeling ever."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9f235b29-d92d-5d01-953e-8cac0365d984 data-container-ref=toofab:article:cf9be186-cbe1-5116-a4b1-d41f88f0829c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/31/5by4/2018/04/30/310cfde11c0d5f96be2717082946b07d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">TooFab</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Meet The Habits: Good Luck Getting This Alt-Pop Trio's Catchy AF Songs Out of Your Head</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Regarding their second EP -- which is projected to drop before the end of the year -- Bahari says it'll be "way more emotional" than "Dancing on the Sun," which the group released in 2016. Their next record, they hope, will reflect the changes they've made both individually and as a band over the last five years.</p><p>Check out the video above to see Bahari's interview and live acoustic performance of their latest single, "Chasers."</p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7b/o/2018/07/09/7beccbb5cd62525aad6436712f61484e_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnl7j3BmbGlfl66prdGiZKydnJq7onnGqKSesl2YtaK%2FxKuqZpmcqXqxu89mqZ6bn6exbrjAm5ylZaSkvKi7zp1kmqqknsC1ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
