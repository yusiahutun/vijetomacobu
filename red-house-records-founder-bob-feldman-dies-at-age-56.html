Red House headquarters has received an<br>overwhelming number of calls and emails from artists, friends, fans and<br>people in the music industry expressing their shock and sadness at the loss.</p><p>He is survived by his wife Beth, son Ari, parents, Sydney and Toby, brother<br>Alan and sister Sheri Cerny.</p><p>Feldman was known across North America as a tireless music promoter and<br>record producer who devoted his life to building and enhancing the careers<br>of many of today's finest roots music artists. As the head of a record<br>label, he had a unique reputation for trusting his artists’ instincts and<br>allowing them ample creative control over their work. Not coincidentally,<br>Feldman maintained close personal relationships with many of the musicians<br>on the label. He acted as a friend, fan, and business partner to many Red<br>House artists – a combination rarely found between artists and the record<br>executives they do business with.</p><p>Red House Records boasts a long list of internationally recognized recording<br>artists including such luminaries as Greg Brown, Lucy Kaplansky, Guy Davis<br>and recent Grammy nominee Eliza Gilkyson. Over the last two years, Feldman<br>made a conscious effort to expand the label’s scope by signing artists who<br>stretched the boundaries of what many consider folk music. Such acts<br>include Austin, Texas based Jimmy LaFave and a bevy of Canadian musicians —<br>The Wailin’ Jennys, The Bills, David Francey, Ray Bonneville and Lynn Miles.</p><p>The staff of Red House Records – long-time friend and V.P. of Production<br>Eric Peltoniemi, V.P. of Operations Chris Frymire, Director of Publicity and<br>Marketing Alex Seitz, Director of Promotions Ellen Stanley, accounting<br>assistant/bookkeeper Megan Hire and members of the Customer Service<br>Department Roland Trenary, Rachel Goligoski and Beth Engelman – will<br>continue operations and passionately pursue Bob Feldman’s vision of<br>cultivating new talent and bringing the highest quality independent music to<br>fans around the world.</p><p>Memorial services will be held tomorrow, Friday, January 13 at 11:30 a.m. at<br>Beth Jacob Synagogue located at 1179 Victoria Curve, Mendota Heights, MN<br>55118.</p><p>Memorials should be directed to the Breast Cancer Fund c/o Red House Records, P.O. Box 4044, St Paul, MN 55104.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGiqlZl6qbvUrJxmqpWYvLOw0madqK2embKzecGomWaelaGxrq3NZpuinaNirrV5wKCcZm1mZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
