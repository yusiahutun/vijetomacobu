Here's Why</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>iCloud Private Relay is a key new feature in iOS 15 that allows you to mask your IP address and browsing activity to prevent you from being tracked online. It is available for free to all iCloud+ subscribers. However, some iPhone users on T-Mobile’s network in the US have been unable to turn on the feature. Instead, they are greeted with an error message stating their cellular plan does not support iCloud Private Relay.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If you are seeing a similar error on your iPhone, worry not. Read on to learn why iCloud Private Relay isn’t working on your iPhone with T-Mobile’s network and what you can do about it.</p><h2 id=it-rsquo-s-not-t-mobile-or-apple-rsquo-s-fault>It’s Not T-Mobile or Apple’s Fault</h2><p>iCloud Private Relay is a VPN-like service from Apple available for free to all iCloud+ subscribers. It is a privacy feature intended to mask your IP address and web browsing activity, thereby keeping your browsing activity safe and private.</p><p>Unlike a fully fledged VPN, though, Private Relay uses your approximate location and doesn’t offer an option to spoof it. This means you can’t use the feature to bypass geo-blocked sites and services.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Since iCloud Private Relay is currently in beta, it is turned off by default. You can enable it on your iPhone or iPad by going to <strong>Settings > Apple ID > iCloud > Private Relay</strong>. However, many T-Mobile iPhone users have been unable to activate the feature on mobile data.</p><p>This led to speculation that T-Mobile is doing this to track its users. After all, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Telegraph</a> highlighted, the carrier signed a joint letter along with Vodafone and other carriers to stop iCloud Private Relay in the EU.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-ios-features-missing-on-android-9.jpg><p>However, T-Mobile issued a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">9to5Mac</a> blaming Apple and a bug in iOS 15.2 for this. It did note, though, that users who have its Web Guard or other content filtering and blocking features enabled won’t be able to use iCloud Private Relay. Built-in content filtering is also a part of T-Mobile’s Home Office Internet plan. These features do the same thing as iCloud Private Relay and are not inter-compatible, which is why T-Mobile disables Apple’s implementation in such scenarios.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Apple, later clarified on its part that there’s no bug in iOS 15.2 that could potentially impact iCloud Private Relay. Instead, it suggested users could be getting the error because they had inadvertently turned off the <strong>Limit IP Address Tracking</strong> feature for mobile data and updated its <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">support page</a> for a clearer picture. The company also updated the wording of the error message in the latest iOS 15.3 beta to reflect this.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>iOS 15.2 Adds 7 New Features to the iPhone</a></span></p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=how-to-enable-icloud-private-relay-on-iphone>How to Enable iCloud Private Relay on iPhone</h2><p>So, how do you enable iCloud Private Relay on your iPhone if you keep getting the error that it’s not available on cellular data? T-Mobile and Apple recommend that you do the following:</p><li>Head over to <strong>Settings > Mobile/Cellular Data > Mobile Data Options</strong> on your iPhone and ensure the <strong>Limit IP Address Tracking</strong> option is enabled.</li><li>Now, head over to <strong>Settings > [your name] > iCloud > Private Relay</strong> and enable the feature.</li>2 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/iPhone-Limit-IP-Address-Tracking.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/iPhone-Enable-iCloud-Private-Relay.jpeg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>You should now be able to use iCloud Private Relay and mask your IP address and browsing activity.
