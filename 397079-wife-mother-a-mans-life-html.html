Both women are important to them, making it a tough decision every time. But who should it be, wife or mother?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1ce5d7a0d3c12e76.jpg><p class=align-left>The decision on who comes first in a man's life, wife or mother is a difficult one. However, with some kind of balance, a man does not have to struggle with this. Learn how to prioritize both women in your life at the time when it matters most.</p><h2>Dealing with the wife or mother dilemma</h2><p class=align-left>Sometimes men are confused about who comes first, your spouse or your parents? Well, this can be a stressful experience for a man. When a man transitions to find a wife, he needs to create boundaries that accommodate the relationships he has between his new wife and his mother who has always been around.</p><p class=align-left>Mothers can be very protective, and if this is not taken care of, it may affect the relationship a man has with his wife. To avoid things going south, it is necessary for a man to set boundaries and rules of engagement. Mothers need to know when they are crossing the line as far as their son's relationship is concerned.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ea7acedaa992ddaa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Man Sets 23 Strict Rules for Estranged Wife Ahead of Reunion: "Must Sleep in Night Dress"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>On the other hand, women who come in as new wives need to acknowledge the role their husband's mum has played all his life. Attempting to push her away, or to downplay her importance will not end well. More often than not, it is such instances that create bad blood and breed enmity.</p><p class=align-left>Unless a mother-in-law is malicious with ill motives from the onset, a wife can easily accommodate her and make their relationships even better. It is all about being respectful and treating her with the honour she deserves. After all, if it were not for her, you will not have a man to get married to.</p><h2>Who comes first, wife or mother according to the Bible?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ea7acedaa992ddaa.jpg><p class=align-left>Biblically speaking, a man and woman will leave their parents and cleave to each other. This means once two people get married, they become each other's priority. The issue of letting parents and relatives interfere with their relationship becomes a non-issue and should not exist in the first place.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9f2601ba3b7af46d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan Man Says Women Leave Men Who Don't Work on Themselves: "Understand Female Nature"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, this being said, wives should not be blatantly disrespectful to their husband's mothers. These are women who bore and nurtured the man into who he is today. Chances are that without the care, motivation, and watchful guidance of their mothers, most men would amount to less than they are today.</p><p class=align-left>This explains why many men will always love their mothers, and constantly seek their opinion in most decisions in life. A smart wife realizes this fact and appreciates it enough to wisely work around it. You do not have to like your mother in-law to appreciate her role in your man's life as a woman.</p><p class=align-left>In some cases, mothers are willing to let go of the role they played in their son's lives before the wife came into the picture. However, they may hold on for a while to see that the wife is worth it. No mother wants to let their son into the hands of a woman who will not care for them as they did.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/698fd424cb77a437.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyans Overwhelmingly Agree Marrying Overly Religious Partner Dims Love Spark in Union</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Wise wives should know this and tread carefully, especially in the early months of the new marriage. Once the mother is confident enough to trust you as her son's wife, she may even do the work for you. You may be surprised at how she convinces your son to go through you when making certain decisions about his life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/526c078a9ca624ea.jpg><p class=align-left>So, there is really no right or wrong answer for the question of who comes first, spouse or parents? The answer depends on the people involved, and how they handle issues. Some men will swear that their mothers will always take the centre stage of their lives, while others will shift the position they once gave their mothers to their new spouses.</p><h2>Who comes first between wife and mother according to Islam?</h2><p class=align-left>Different religions have different beliefs. Like Christianity where married couples need to focus on building a home without the interference of their relatives, Islam has its own beliefs. On this subject, Islam prioritizes the wife over the mother.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9274f79b3e8b94e0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyans Express Mixed Reactions Over Mbeere Men Who Share Household Duties With Wives</span></p></a><p class=align-left>According to the narration of<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> al-Bukhaari, </a>5514; Muslim, 4621, men should always put their wives first when it comes to decision making. In the same manner, if a man has limited resources and cannot spend on both mother and wife at the same time, then he should prioritize the wife's needs first.</p><p class=align-left>From the above arguments, it appears as though both Islam and Christianity are on the same page. Once a man marries, his wife takes centre stage. It does not matter how much he loves his mother, but the wife should always come first.</p><h3>Who is important between wife and mother?</h3><p class=align-left>It may not be easy to point out who is important between the two women because there is no straight answer for this. The truth is, it is a complicated choice, and having to select between the two is a bias. You will certainly leave with your wife for as long as you stay married, but there is also the fact that your mother is always going to be the constant that never changes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3f704bcc3573df53_w.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Benjamin Zulu: Marrying religious, overdressed women could put you in perpetual dry spell</span></p></a><p class=align-left>With such tough facts above, it is never easy to decide. So, should your spouse be your first priority? Yes, and no because whether you prioritize her or not will depend on the situation on the ground.</p><p class=align-left>It is possible that your mother needs more help than your wife at any particular time. The only logical thing to do in such a case is to handle the critical issues first, no matter whom it concerns. For instance, when your mother is sick, and your wife needs a new dress, logic demands that you address the sickness issue first before you come to your wife's needs.</p><p class=align-left>On the question of the wife or mother coming first in a man's life, it is necessary for the man to be an independent thinker. Do not neglect both women because they have crucial roles in your life. A wife is equally important as a mother, hence the need to find a balance without compromising the peace of your home.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9d7ac94e03cf5707.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mum divorced after 12 years of marriage says she stayed single to focus on her kids</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In other news, <a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> posted a story of a single <a href=#>mother raising 12 kids</a> alone after losing her sister to the Covid19 pandemic.
