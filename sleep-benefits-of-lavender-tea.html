Just hearing the word evokes relaxing images of purple fields and sweetly scented sachets. But this popular herb is much more than just a pretty face. It’s packed with health-boosting essential oils and unique compounds proven to decrease anxiety, lower blood pressure, soothe migraines, boost immunity and more. And the sleep benefits of lavender tea can’t be understated.</p><p>“Lavender tea has gained recognition for its potential to induce a sense of relaxation,” confirms critical care and sleep expert <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Raj Dasgupta, MD,</a> Chief Medical Advisor for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sleepopolis.com</a> and Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine at Keck School of Medicine at USC. Indeed, simply taking a moment out of your busy routine to enjoy a cuppa is revitalizing unto itself. “Preparing and sipping tea is so calming, because you’re forced to slow down — you can’t chug it like a Red Bull,” laughs physician and nutrition specialist <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Melina Jampolis, MD</a>, author of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spice Up, Live Long</a> and founder of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ahara.com</a>. “This soothing ritual helps reduce stress, further amplifying lavender’s many health benefits.”</p><p>Read on to discover how drinking a cup of floral, aromatic lavender tea can improve your health from head to toe.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The history of lavender as a health booster</h2><p>Modern science may prove the health benefits of this versatile herb, but knowledge of its antibacterial and medicinal properties stretches as far back as the dawn of the Great Pyramids. “Ancient Egyptians used lavender essential oil in their mummification ceremonies, while practitioners of ancient <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ayurvedic medicine</a> used it in therapeutic massage and medieval doctors treated seizures with it,” reveals physician <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Valerie Cacho, MD</a>, triple board-certified in internal, sleep and integrative medicine. Fast forward a few hundred years, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Queen Elizabeth I</a> started sipping lavender tea to help relieve her migraines. After all, “heavy is the head that wears the crown”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-1411015727-2.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The sleep benefits of lavender tea</h2><p>Go ahead and pour another cuppa. Lavender tea helps you get sweeter, deeper sleep in multiple ways.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>It helps you doze off faster and sleep deeper</h3><p>Research shows simply inhaling the scent of lavender as you sip is enough to trigger the release of the sleep hormone <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">melatonin</a>. “About 98% of lavender’s sleep benefits are indirect, because it helps manage anxiety,” explains Dr. Jampolis. “And that makes a lot of sense. Anytime a patient comes in and says to me, ‘I’m not sleeping well,’ I say, ‘Well, are you under more stress than usual?’ That’s my number one question, because high levels of anxiety and sleep problems are so intertwined.”</p><p>To reap the sleep benefits of lavender tea (one of nature’s best “nerve tonics”), simply sip lavender tea about 30 minutes before bed, advises <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh Axe, DC, DNM, CNS</a>. The more senses you can involve, the better, so consider tucking a small lavender sachet under your pillow, too. Dr. Cacho adds, “One of my favorite studies shows that just placing lavender near seniors’ pillows in a nursing home significantly improved their anxiety and helped them achieve <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">deeper levels of sleep</a>.” (Not a fan of lavender tea?

Also smart: Spritzing your sheets with a mister bottle of water infused with 5 drops of lavender essential oil.

And the little mini-awakenings (called “micro arousals”) that snoring causes can leave you tossing and turning and exhausted when you wake. Fortunately, research suggests tapping into the sleep benefits of lavender tea can help.</p><p>A plant compound called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">linalool</a> mimics estrogen, and daily contact helps offset hormonal shifts that worsen snoring. At the same time, linalool instantly increases blood flow to tighten lax tissues in the throat responsible for rattling.

Read on to discover the other ways lavender tea can boost your health and happiness.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>It soothes stress and beats the blues</h3><p>The key to lavender’s medicinal might lies in its ability to dial down the stress hormone <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cortisol</a>. As Dr. Cacho explains, “lavender essential oil works phenomenally to boost <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GABA</a>, a relaxing neurotransmitter that decreases anxiety.” (Click through to discover how <a href=#>essential oils can boost your focus</a> and memory, too.)</p><p>In fact, research in the journal Complementary Therapies in Medicine showed that people who drink about 1 cup of lavender tea twice a day slashed their levels of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">anxiety and depression</a>. Another study in Worldwide Views on Evidence-Based Nursing showed that women who drank 1 cup of lavender tea for two weeks (while also taking it its soothing aroma) reported significantly less <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">depression and fatigue</a>.</p><p>Not only that, a study in the journal Phytomedicine found that lavender may work even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">better than anxiety medication</a>. That’s a finding that surprised Dr. Jampolis. “The study showed that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">silexan</a> [a lavender oil preparation available in tablets] works better than the anxiety medication Ativan — and 80 mg. of silexan is equal to 20 mg. of Paxil.” (Click through to our sister publication to see three simple ways to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">quiet anxiety in seconds.</a>)</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fennel Tea Can Ease Bloat, Calm Stress + Boost Sleep — How to Brew It for Pennies</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>It lowers high blood pressure</h3><p>Given its relaxing effects, it makes sense that lavender also has been shown to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">decrease blood pressure</a>, according to a study in Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Researchers found that the linalool in the herb lowers blood pressure as much as 4 points in 20 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>“There is a very strong association between stress and blood pressure,” confirms Dr. Jampolis. She says that inhaling the scent of lavender or drinking the tea helps calm the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal </a>(HPA) axis, a kind of “super-highway” between the brain and stress hormones. “Doctors are constantly changing patients’ blood pressure medications to try to deal with their side effects [from brain fog to stomach aches], so it’s great news that lavender can help lower blood pressure naturally.” (Click through to see how <a href=#>indulging in chocolate</a> can help curb high blood pressure, too.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-1394307666-2.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>It soothes migraine pain</h3><p>By taming stress — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the most common migraine trigger</a> — lavender soothes headache pain, notes Dr. Axe. He also credits the herb’s ability to alleviate muscle tension. In fact, one study in Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine showed that just inhaling the scent of lavender for 15 minutes significantly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reduced migraine pain</a>. And research in the Journal of Herbal Medicine revealed that taking in its aroma dramatically <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">slashed headache frequency</a> over three months.</p><p>Further proof it works: Research in the journal European Neurology found smelling the scent of lavender <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tamped down migraines</a> for 74% of folks.
