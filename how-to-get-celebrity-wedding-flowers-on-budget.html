And when it comes to <a class=hm-link href=#>celebrity weddings</a>, it appears there is no such thing as too many flowers!</p><p id=eVxXZd7AJkQv data-wc=76>Flower walls, elaborate arches and dramatic installations have all featured in the weddings of stars from Kim Kardashian to the <a class=hm-link href=#>Duke and Duchess of Sussex</a>, sparking a trend among brides and grooms hoping to create a beautiful floral backdrop to their own wedding days. However, the cost of those pristine white roses and pretty peonies can soon stack up.

Louise says: "Gain a good basic knowledge of the techniques and styles of bouquets. A hand-tied bouquet filled with seasonal blooms will probably cost around half the price of an intricately wired piece filled with exotic or rare flowers. I would say that if you choose anywhere to blow the budget, make it here. The bouquet will be in most of your photographs and with you all day, and two to three expensive flowers mixed with fillers and foliage will go a long way. Why not ask your venue or florist for some extra vases to display the bridal party flowers next to your cake or on the top table after the ceremony and photographs?"</p><h2>The fabulous floral centrepieces</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/14478d7ad1e7-princess-eugenie-wedding-flowers-z.jpg><p id=eEEV7kAN71t0 data-wc=54>Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank <a class=hm-link href=#>incorporated autumnal florals and foliage into their wedding day</a>, both outside St. George's Chapel and inside Windsor Castle, where they hosted their reception. But you don't need to spend a fortune to recreate their regal floral displays – you could even just invest in one multi-use centrepiece that can be moved from your ceremony to reception venues.</p><p id=ebvJdU12_vBk data-wc=116>"We usually recommend that our couples go for one main epic feature, such as a large centerpiece in the middle of the room, surrounded by smaller table settings. This gives an illusion of grandeur without blowing the budget on every table,"&nbsp;Louise recommends. "Installations that can be moved from one place to another are also great, such as a ceremony arrangement then moved to the top table or reception entrance will give you double the impact. It's also a good idea to ensure that everything flows well, using the same colour way and flower variety, this naturally makes the eyes travel around the room, creating fullness and flow. Mixing heights on tables offers more variety too."</p><p id=eTbc9YQv0qso data-wc=1><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>Your ultimate guide to choosing your wedding flowers from Pippa Middleton's florist</a></strong></p><p id=e5ukRXOy7OSF data-wc=90>You could even utilise centrepieces that can be planted afterwards as a memento of your wedding day for years to come. "Lots of our couples are asking for 'foliage only' displays at the moment, or why not try using real trees? This enables you to give them as gifts to the wedding party afterwards or plant in your garden to enjoy forever. You could also use single flower bud vases, grouped together with candles, this idea uses only a handful of blooms and minimal time and effort for your florist."</p><h2>The flower arch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c21fba583e55-millie-mackintosh-wedding-flower-arch-z.jpg><p id=eftrGZY11R4X data-wc=54>It isn't a celebrity wedding without a flower arch! As seen at the weddings of everyone from <a class=hm-link href=#>Millie Mackintosh</a> to <a class=hm-link href=#>Declan Donnelly</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Pippa Middleton</a>, it's no wonder brides are clamouring to incorporate one into their&nbsp;big day. While you could <a class=hm-link href=#>attempt a DIY flower arch</a>, Louise has some clever tips to cut costs while still creating a spectacular backdrop to your nuptials.</p><p id=eTsskirQ2sal data-wc=56>"The key here is to use larger headed flowers such as hydrangeas, dahlias and peonies, mixed with less pricey filler flowers. Lots of greenery can also help to build width and height at a lower cost. Balloons and paper pom-poms could be added as a low-cost quirky filler to really make a trend-driven statement," Louise says.</p><p id=eVz7s7D9W_Li data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>The 2019 wedding flower trends you need to know</a></strong></p><p id=ewMWyic-EWBj data-wc=64>"Why not ask your florist if you can incorporate foliage from your garden in the same way that Harry and Meghan did at Windsor castle?

But you don’t need to spend a fortune to recreate the look. "This is probably the only time that we might suggest artificial flowers. The heat from your body and being worn all day means that flower crowns are quite often put under a lot of stress,"&nbsp;Louise says. "Deciding to use artificial flowers also means that you can buy in advance and try on with your dress and veil if you are having one, and use for overseas weddings. If artificial isn't for you, try hardy varieties of flowers such as roses, gypsophila and foliage from the eucalyptus family."</p><p id=ebumlmay1iTz data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
