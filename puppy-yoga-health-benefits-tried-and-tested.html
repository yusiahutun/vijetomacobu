Playing with a pet is proven to reduce stress and anxiety levels, help with depression, ease loneliness, encourage exercise, and even improve your cardiovascular health. Hence the birth of one of the craziest (and cutest) health fads, puppy yoga.</p><p id=efCJTUbFfy9 data-wc=65><a class=hm-link href=#>Yoga</a> is known for its stress-busting and mood-boosting benefits, so adding cute puppies into the mix theoretically serves to intensify these feelings. I headed down to a puppy yoga class at Strek <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>hosted by Puply</a> in association with activewear brand Bo+Tee and Shout to see what the fuss is all about and discover whether a Downward Dog surrounded by actual dogs can make you happier.</p><h2>What is puppy yoga?</h2><p id=eLfo49bBKpZ data-wc=39>Puppy yoga does what it says on the tin – it’s a yoga class involving puppies. The idea is that combining the physical benefits of a yoga session with the serotonin-spiking presence of puppies gives you double the joy.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: What's the one thing that makes you happy?</figure><p id=eUnphyxvt77 data-wc=28>The puppies are typically allowed to roam freely around the yoga space, interacting with people during the session, or may be let out after the class has ended.</p><p id=eAcwb1pRs49 data-wc=51>Let’s be honest – there's not a whole lot of yoga involved. Puppy yoga is not for those seeking a challenging workout. The flow will typically be shorter and low energy, with the focus very much on the moment the precious pups will be let loose for those all-important photo opportunities.</p><p id=eKciSKmRg4H data-wc=17><strong>&nbsp;SEE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>I suffer from SAD, and this is the one thing that lifts my mood without fail</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a9f67e35718f-malamut-puppy-cute-walking.jpg><h2>What are the health benefits of puppy yoga?</h2><p id=eLZYpnKKq-eL data-wc=6>The benefits of puppy yoga include:</p><ul><li>reduced loneliness</li><li>social interaction for the puppies</li><li>improved mental health</li></ul><p id=e11O5d-5YpY data-wc=40><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Pickleball Feature</a> founder Michael explains the science behind it: "Puppy yoga offers a unique combination of physical and mental health benefits. Participants not only enjoy a fun, playful workout, but they also experience a boost in mood and stress relief.</p><p id=eFAMhawIAwz data-wc=37>"Interacting with puppies releases feel-good hormones like oxytocin, which can lower anxiety and promote a sense of calm. Moreover, the presence of these adorable animals encourages participants to fully engage in the practice, improving focus and mindfulness."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1d3350f24709-yoga-teacher-posing-mat-dog.jpg><h2 data-gid=e8Tra5KVizzv>Did puppy yoga actually benefit my mental health?</h2><p id=eMA4_2q_nWE data-wc=45>We were guided through a 20-minute Vinyasa flow at the airy Strek Studio in London.
