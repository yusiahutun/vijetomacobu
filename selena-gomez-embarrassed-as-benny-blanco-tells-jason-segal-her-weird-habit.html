Of course, the Single Soon star didn’t have any words prepared to say to the star, but Blanco stepped in.</p><p>“She falls asleep to you every night,” he told the 44-year-old as Gomez hung her head in shame with the “weird comment,” as the crowd erupted in laughter.</p><p>However, she revealed she actually does, as she has a “weird habit” of falling asleep to comfort shows, and at the moment, it’s How I Met Your Mother.</p><p>Maybe use a better choice of words next time Benny…</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-feels-the-safest-with-her-new-boyfriend>The star feels the ‘safest’ with her new boyfriend</h2><p>As she continues to promote her new single, Love On, the 31-year-old also continues to gush about her 35-year-old boyfriend.</p><p>Speaking to Zane Lowe for Apple Music 1 the <a href=#>music</a> star said: “Without getting into too much detail, I think it’s just really important to meet someone that respects you. And I think it’s really nice to also lean on someone who understands the world that I live in.”</p><p>“I’d have to say overall, it’s the safest that I feel and it’s been really lovely,” she concluded.</p><p>Gomez famously dated <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> on and off from 2011-2018.
