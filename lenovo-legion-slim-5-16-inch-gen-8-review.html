Since then, the sub-brand has experienced significant growth.</p><p>The Lenovo Legion Slim 5 Gen 8 laptop is a powerful device with impressive internal specs, a sleek design, and a mostly exceptional display.

Additionally, you can select between two NVIDIA GeForce graphics cards, RTX 4050 or RTX 4060, as well as 16GB of memory and up to 1TB of storage.</p><p>The Lenovo Slim 5i laptops offer different Intel models with an Intel Core i5-13500H or Intel Core i7-13700H processor.

As its name suggests, it's very thin, as it weighs just 5.3 pounds and is 0.78 inches thick. The word "Legion" is ingrained at the top left of the case (when looking at it from behind with the display open), while "Lenovo" is printed vertically along the bottom right. The top is made from aluminum, with the rest of the chassis made of hard plastic.</p><p>I received the Storm Gray variant for review, and it proved to be both elegant and subtle. However, like other Lenovo laptops in this color, it is prone to smudges from fingerprints, which somewhat detracts from its appearance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although it is technically possible to open the Lenovo Legion Slim 5 with one hand, I'd recommend using the other hand for extra support. Once opened, you will immediately notice the thin bezels surrounding the matte panel. Additionally, the lid can be adjusted to different angles, including laying it flat at 180 degrees.</p><p>You'll find speaker cutouts and a nicely sized ventilation grill on the bottom panel. The notebook releases air through four vents, with two on the back and one on each side.</p><h3 id=ports>Ports</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lenovo-legion-slim-5-gen-8-ports.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lenovo-legion-slim-5-5.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lenovo-legion-slim-5-4.jpg> <span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This laptop has a variety of ports located in three different areas. To the left, there are two USB Type-C 3.2 (Gen. 2) ports that support DisplayPort 1.4. One of these offers 140W power delivery. The headphone/mic combo can always be found on the left side.On the right side, there is a 4-in-1 SD card reader and an E-shutter button for the webcam. The laptop's rear has an Ethernet (RJ45) jack, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports (one with always-on 5V2A), and HDMI 2.1.</p><h3 id=keyboard-and-touchpad>Keyboard and TouchPad</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lenovo-legion-slim-5-3.jpg><p>This keyboard has six rows of keys that are 1.5mm in size. It also has a number pad on the right side and large arrow keys. The four-zone RGB lighting glows in white.</p><p>Overall, I enjoyed typing on this keyboard. The keys were easy to move between and had just the right amount of tactile feedback to make it enjoyable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=display-good-and-bad>Display: Good and Bad</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lenovo-legion-slim-5-7.jpg><p>The display on my review unit features a WQXGA IPS panel with a 165Hz refresh rate and a resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels (189 PPI). It has a 16:10 screen ratio.</p><p>The laptop's screen has a brightness rating of 300 nits, which is not very high, making it challenging to use the device in outdoor settings. Interestingly, this appears to be a common issue among some of the latest mid-range laptops this year, with vivid colors but poor maximum brightness. This was also observed in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lenovo Yoga 7i 16-Inch Gen 8</a> and <a href=#>Lenovo Slim Pro 7</a>.</p><p>The display doesn't offer touch, which is unfortunate, but not surprising for a gaming laptop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=software-packing-a-bunch>Software: Packing a Bunch</h2><p>The Lenovo laptop includes Lenovo Vantage and Legion Arena software. Lenovo Vantage is a comprehensive program providing security and support options for all computers and tablets. It also enables you to perform diagnostics and update drivers.</p><p>Legion Arena is a gaming location that connects to popular platforms and online stores, making it easier for you to find all of your purchased PC games in one centralized hub.</p><p>New users will receive a three-month Xbox Game Pass trial, alongside McAfee LiveSafe and Microsoft 365 trials.</p><h2 id=performance-great-power-for-the-price>Performance: Great Power for the Price</h2><p>As I noted above, I was fortunate to receive a review unit AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS processor. It also came with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. There's also NVIDIA G-SYNC and AMD FreeSync Premium support for ultra-smooth gameplay.</p><p>After carrying out several real-world tests, the laptop demonstrated exceptional performance. It swiftly opened multiple windows in Google Chrome and had no difficulties when using Adobe Photoshop. The Dolby Vision HDR feature produced stunningly clear visuals in terms of gaming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, Lenovo Legion ColdFront 5.0 thermal technology keeps the laptop relatively cool and quiet during operation.</p><h2 id=battery-life-varied-findings>Battery Life: Varied Findings</h2><p>The Lenovo Legion Slim 5 Gen 8's battery life varies based on usage. Typically, it lasts between 5 and 8 hours before requiring a recharge. When gaming, the battery life is closer to the lower end of the spectrum. However, the laptop has a rapid charging feature that can increase your battery capacity to 70% within 30 minutes, which is a great feature. I tested and confirmed this capability and even exceeded it slightly.</p><h2 id=should-you-buy-the-lenovo-legion-5-16-quot-gen-8>Should You Buy the Lenovo Legion 5 (16", Gen 8)?</h2><p>If you're searching for a gaming laptop that's reasonably priced, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Lenovo Legion 5 (16", Gen 8)</a> is a great option. However, I recommend investing in the version that features the WQXGA IPS panel with 2560 x 1600 pixels. Additionally, it's wise to consider purchasing one with more than 512GB of storage, particularly if you intend to store many games on it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/legion-slim-5.png> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-ec_final.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>Lenovo Legion Slim 5 (16", Gen 8)</h5><p class=display-card-description>The Lenovo Legion Slim 5 is a terrific 16-inch laptop for gamers of any skill set.
