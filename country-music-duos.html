Longevity is often the hardest part. Several of the&nbsp;unions described here ended early because of creative differences, in-fighting or tragedy.

That means successful solo artists who came together for a song or album were not considered, even if — like <a href=#>Conway Twitty</a> and <a href=#>Loretta Lynn</a> — they won a bunch of CMA Awards. Duos were carved out of Vocal Group categories at country awards shows starting in 1988, which made a scan through classic country group winners necessary. We think we found them all, but you can be&nbsp;the final judge.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top 20 Country Music Duos, Ranked!</h2>The best <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">country duos</a> combine unbelievable talent, songwriting skills and proficiency as live entertainers. These 20 do that to varying degrees, but only one has been certified as Entertainer of the Year.<p>Find that duo at No. 1 but, but learn about many more from the 1960s, '70s, '80s, '90s and 2000s before you get there. This list of country music's top duos focuses on artists who broke as a duo, not solo artists who came together for an album or series of projects after enjoying commercial success. Contemporary artists are mixed with legends and Country Music Hall of Famers throughout this list.
