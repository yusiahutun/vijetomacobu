When I complained to my grandfather, he asked me to open the window and just breathe in because, according to him, the air smelled like money.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The world had become engulfed by the HIV/Aids epidemic by the late 1980s. Seeing the dire need for condoms, gloves and other protective gear, the family decided to make the leap from rubber processing into finished products. In 1988, the company made a swift transition from producing different types of medical supplies to focusing on condoms.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How Lotte went from making gum to a global leisure giant</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We learned everything about the process only after we bought our first machine. My uncles Goh Siang and Goh Leng Kian were in charge because they were both certified engineers,” Goh Miah Kiat says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In the beginning, it wasn’t easy to sell our condoms. People were more inclined to buy well-known international brands. This is the same kind of brand familiarity that people always look for when buying items like toothpaste, shampoo or even medicine,” he explains.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At this point the company was called Banrub – “ban” means plentiful in Teochew, the family’s native Chinese dialect, and “rub” was short for rubber. The name was not much of an asset when the company was struggling in the early 1990s and so it was relaunched as Karex in 1994. The new name is a combination of the words “caring” and “excellence”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/09/19/669151f8-f64e-11ea-a41c-8cbd1416100a_972x_134936.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When the change of name brought the company better luck and fortune, Karex moved production to a bigger plant in Johor’s Pontian district that same year. The location, near the country’s main ports and directly across the border from Singapore, made transporting goods easier.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I learned a lot in the early days. I took over sales and marketing after completing my studies in Sydney because I liked the challenge of trying to sell things. I was doing very well, but being young I still wanted to travel and explore the world.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“One trip that really changed my life was when I travelled to Uganda. We hear about HIV and Aids all the time, but most of us have not really seen people who suffer from it because people don’t really talk about it,” says Goh.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Witnessing the situation in Uganda and learning that more than 30 million Africans had been infected by the disease made him realise the importance of his company’s products and understand that he had the power to change and save lives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/09/19/4e65e86a-f64d-11ea-a41c-8cbd1416100a_1320x770_134936.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Karex takes pride in making products that people actually want instead of simply need. With its engineering expertise, the company has changed perceptions of condoms by making them fun and something more than just a contraceptive device. From glow-in-the-dark and colour-changing condoms to durian- and rendang-flavoured varieties, Karex continues to push the boundaries and turn condoms into pleasure enhancers. (Durian is a fruit with pungent flesh, while rendang is a spicy beef and coconut milk dish.)</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Goh is often amused by the reactions he receives when explaining his line of business. Coming from a Muslim-majority country like Malaysia, he understands there is a degree of resistance to talking about sex.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Malaysians are not so bad, because we are multiracial and quite secular compared to those in some other Muslim countries. There are people who still find things like sex and condoms taboo, but it all comes down to education,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/09/19/c0fca592-f64f-11ea-a41c-8cbd1416100a_1320x770_134936.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We have to keep in mind that we are doing a genuine business and there is nothing illegal about it. Karex always tries to educate and make our products fun, like launching condoms with local flavours such as nasi lemak and rendang. This allows people to have conversations about them,” says Goh. (Nasi lemak is dish of fragrant rice cooked with coconut milk and pandan leat.)</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Along the way, Karex has acquired a number of international brands to make it the largest condom manufacturer in the world, and it continues to market its original in-house condom brand, Carex.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The One condom is currently Karex’s bestselling variety, along with MyOne, which was rebranded and marketed by the company’s team in the United States. UK brand Pasente, which is a supplier for Britain’s National Health Service, and Trustex, a brand from the US, are also owned by Karex.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/09/19/d43f6776-f64e-11ea-a41c-8cbd1416100a_972x_134936.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company has tried to reinvent the condom by tackling issues such as durability and fit. MyOne, for example, is a customisable condom line that allows users to go online with their measurements and find the perfect fit – there are more than 60 different sizes available on its website.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Moving forward, Karex is looking into the feasibility of producing more condoms from synthetic materials.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The condom world is moving into synthetics. Now, 95 per cent of condoms are still made from natural rubber, but rubber prices have been depressed during the past few years and not much research has been done,” Goh says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/09/19/6e3c1746-f651-11ea-a41c-8cbd1416100a_972x_134936.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Malaysia is no longer the number one rubber producer in the world. If we want to produce a product as thin as rubber, there needs to be improvement not only in the processes but also in the materials. We have conducted a few years of research and hope to launch something soon.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like the rest of the world, Karex was hit by the Covid-19 pandemic more than 30 years after HIV/Aids, but this time the company has been affected in a different way. Its distribution chain was disrupted when convenience stores, pharmacies and shopping malls were ordered to close amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Production was shut down for 10 days before resuming for a month at only 50 per cent capacity. Now that Karex is fully operational again, and with the help of its largest manufacturing site across the border in Hat Yai, Thailand, it aims to make up for lost time.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Rise of a rubber giant</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLWmrcutn2avlaG5r7HSrGaaqqSesK2xjmxoaWlnaIBwv9OoqbJlm5a%2FpsSMoaawZaKqr6Ox0WaaqKWglru6ecKopaydoquutbXVnmSmmZyWxrS1wA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
