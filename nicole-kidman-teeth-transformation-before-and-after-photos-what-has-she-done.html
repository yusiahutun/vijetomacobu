"The healing process depends on the patient," he added. "But it can take anything from a few days to a few weeks."</p><h2>Smile dimensions</h2><p id=eRCjhaS_xy data-wc=55>"If we compare old pictures to new pictures, we can see that Nicole Kidman’s teeth have always appeared straight, although they do lean slightly inwards and the proportions are ever so slightly irregular," Dr. Jethwa explained. <strong>"Her smile looks more mature now, in a good way with more width and balance with her natural asymmetries.</strong>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f8378db18f60-nicole-kidman-teeth-2000.jpg><p id=e6incADi7XA data-wc=59>"Her smile is what we call 'harmonious', in keeping with her facial features, working with the asymmetries of the face. In more current pictures dimensions of her smile seemed to have changed. <strong>She now has what we like to call a ‘wide smile’,&nbsp;</strong> where the smile is typically wider and displays more of the upper teeth than the lower."</p><h2>Dental veneers</h2><p id=eFWcPDUca9 data-wc=57><a class=hm-link href=#>Dental veneers</a> appear to have played a big part in altering Nicole's smile and the experts agree. "We can see from Nicole Kidman’s smile that it has changed considerably over the years," said Dr. Richard Marques BDS of <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Doctor Richard London</a>. "Her original smile was quite uneven, but her smile is now whiter and much more even.</p><p id=eIb1sJwAyn6 data-wc=36><strong>"In my opinion she has had teeth straightening and whitening and she may well have had some natural looking veneers.</strong> As a dentist I think her smile looks great and still has a lot of character.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/179b763ef96d-nicole-kidman-yellow-dress.jpg><p id=edKF86cFrLw data-wc=57>Dr. Jethwa further elaborated on the theory of Nicole's veneers by adding: "Veneers may be necessary to create a more even smile, which is what I believe Nicole Kidman has had. It appears that Nicole’s top eight teeth have been improved with ultra thin porcelain veneer treatment. Often eight or ten upper teeth are the chosen option.</p><p id=eSEmHftIVz data-wc=37>"Dental veneers are essentially a covering for the natural teeth, and will be made of either composite resin or porcelain. <strong>They are bonded to the front of the tooth to change their color, shape, size or length."</strong></p><p id=erWuX9QtKV data-wc=29>And he clarified that while many people assume that to have veneer's their teeth need to be drilled down and transformed into small pegs, "this is not the case".&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8936875bb56d-nicole-kidman-teeth-today.jpg><p id=eU_gLXCxhI data-wc=54>"This treatment is minimally invasive and we will always preserve as much of the natural tooth as we can. It is just not necessary to drill them down so much. On average, our ultra thin veneers can last from 10 to 15 years, and with excellent care they can last up to 20 years."&nbsp;</p><h2>Teeth whitening&nbsp;</h2><p id=eXs2e0FmmO data-wc=40>Dr. Jethwa and Dr. &nbsp;Marques also believe Nicole has had her teeth whitened and said that although dental veneers do not require whitening treatment, it looks as if her bottom teeth have been brightened up to match her top ones.</p><p id=e_Gj3Eb1tAo data-wc=13>Note: Neither Dr. Sam Jethwa nor Dr. Richard Marques have treated Nicole Kidman.</p><p id=e8xRlIFeAT data-wc=31></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
