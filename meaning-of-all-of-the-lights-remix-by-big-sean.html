The lyrics explore the prominent role that lights play in our lives, symbolizing various aspects such as success, fame, self-discovery, and overcoming adversity. With its energetic beats and catchy melodies, the song sets the stage for a deep dive into the multifaceted meanings behind the lyrics.One standout lyric in the song is Lil Wayne's line, "She eat me up, she got expensive taste." This lyric taps into the theme of desires and the pursuit of extravagance. It suggests that the subject of the song is attracted to someone who appreciates the finer things in life. The lyric also implies that the attraction is based on materialistic enjoyment rather than deeper emotional connections. This theme of seeking validation and high-end experiences aligns with the overarching idea of basking in the allure of bright lights.Another interesting lyric is found in Big Sean's verse. He raps, "Why every rapper named 'Big' got bodied, huh? But every rapper named 'Sean' got money?" This lyric offers social commentary and explores the theme of identity and perception in the music industry. It suggests that artists who adopt the name "Big" often face struggles and challenges, while those who go by "Sean" tend to find success and financial stability. This clever play on names serves as a metaphor for the highs and lows musicians encounter on their journey to fame and fortune, emphasizing the fickleness of the industry's perception.Rihanna's powerful chorus, "Turn up the lights in here, baby. Extra bright, I want y'all to see this," reinforces the central theme of visibility and validation. With the lights symbolizing the spotlight or public attention, she expresses the desire to be noticed and appreciated for her achievements. This yearning for recognition is a common human experience and resonates with anyone who has ever felt unrecognized or underappreciated in their life. Through this lyric, Rihanna invites listeners to embrace their own accomplishments and embrace the metaphorical light that shines upon them.Drake's verse in the song contributes to the theme of personal growth and self-confidence. He raps, "I made mistakes, I made some bread. I even made a way for them to get ahead." This lyric highlights the journey from making errors to achieving success and extending that success to others. It suggests that Drake has not only learned from his own missteps but also created opportunities for others to thrive.
