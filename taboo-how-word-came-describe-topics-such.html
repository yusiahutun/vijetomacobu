Every one was Tabu, a word of very comprehensive meaning but in general signifies forbidden.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This was the first of several of his entries of the Tongan word tabu (with stress on the initial syllable), meaning sacred, forbidden; or set apart for special use or purpose or for the use of a god, king, priest or chief; or prohibited to a particular class (especially women) or to persons under a perpetual or temporary prohibition from certain actions, food or contact.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The word and meaning are found across the region: tabu in several languages of Melanesia and Micronesia, including some of the islands of Vanuatu, Kiribati and Papua New Guinea, tapu in Polynesian languages Tahitian and Maori, and kapu in Hawaiian.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Tongan form was adopted into English as taboo (and tapu in New Zealand and Maori English), with stress on the final syllable, as adjective, noun and verb, in reference to such observed customs in the Pacific, and, subsequently, in the early 19th century, other “primitive” cultures.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/20/e15ed6d3-6056-486d-9ca2-e6957915e238_8dc991a5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It soon came to be used figuratively in relation to the prohibition not just of practices as dictated by religious or social custom, but more generally of the use or practice of anything. Contemporary examples include taboo topics (for instance, of menstruation, or race, or finances), and dating a colleague being considered taboo.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Linguistic taboo involves the total or partial prohibition of the use of certain words, expressions or topics, especially in social intercourse – swearing is the highly emotive use of taboo terms.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The language of taboo in traditional cultures continues to serve its purpose in the modern day.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Black swan metaphor had a different meaning until nature intervened</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In March 2020, to prevent further transmission of Covid-19 among Easter Island’s Rapa Nui people, the island’s mayor banned all incoming flights – but had to manage the islanders’ concerns about the potential impact on their tourism-based economy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To do so, he relied on the discourse of tapu – foregrounding the principle of respected, sacred, shared prohibitions, defining things that are tapu as to be kept at a distance, temporarily isolated.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Drawing on the traditional knowledge and language of tapu proved crucial to the island effecting quarantine and ultimately attaining zero Covid.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOrJ%2BoqqRiv6atw6xmmqqknrCtsY5saHFqY2yDcMDAm6aoZZikxG7DzqubZpuRorJusMSsmquhkpp6tbvPopqsZaOqsKk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
