Christmas is no exception.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>On the first Saturday in December, the sizzle of hot grills and the aroma of doughy batter transforming into round, golden pancakes fill the streets of downtown. Long lines of laughing neighbors and families with bundled-up children form along the edges of the YMCO and First Baptist Church to get their stack of all-you-can-eat hotcakes.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Erin shares, "</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>If you've ever lived in Laurel, you know the magic of Pancake Day. The early morning hours on the first Saturday in December are spent in line on Oak Street at the door of the old YWCO for pancakes and sausage, along with every person I've ever known in my life. Everyone shares tables with old friends, cousins, aunts, and uncles who've been doing this since they were young, too. In a few short hours, Mississippi's longest Christmas parade rolls through downtown, and Laurel becomes something you only see in the movies.</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Pancake Day festivities usually prelude the Downtown Laurel Christmas parade, the longest parade in Mississippi. This year, the Christmas parade will roll through downtown on the Friday night of December 1, 2021.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In her interview with Good Grit magazine, Erin says,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"Everyone you've ever known in your whole life is inside, having all-you-can-eat pancakes, sausage, and coffee — gossiping, hugging, laughing, hollering. It's like getting to be a child all over again every year. It never feels old; it always feels like Christmas should feel. Like home, I guess."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Pancake Day is a scene from a classic Christmas movie, and it's no coincidence that Laurel Mercantile Co. opened its doors on this special day almost five years ago. What better way to usher in a birthday than with endless pancakes?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Join us this Pancake Day by purchasing your ticket from any Kiwanis Club of Laurel member for $6 or at the door for $7.
