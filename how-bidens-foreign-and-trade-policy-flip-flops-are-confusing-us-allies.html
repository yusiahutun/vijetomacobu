Realism is a theoretical framework that emphasises the absence of a central authority above the state and the constraints of politics imposed by national interest.Kissinger is credited for maintaining America’s powerful reputation – a vital national interest during the Cold War. For instance, as the <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Cultural Revolution</span></a> in China was ending, he paid a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">clandestine visit</span></a> to Beijing in 1971 to set up the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">historical meeting</span></a> between US president Richard Nixon and Chinese leader Mao Zedong in 1972. This paved the path for the US to establish diplomatic relations with Beijing.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kissinger may not have agreed with communism, but he thought that establishing ties with China was a reasonable compromise; it would allow the US to drive a wedge between China and the Soviet Union, strengthening America’s influence in Asia.</p>Like Kissinger, Biden is seen as a realist. But unlike Kissinger, who served as secretary of state for four years, Biden has had a long political career spanning 36 years in the senate, eight years as vice-president, and as president since 2021. With nearly five decades of experience of working with different parties, Biden has become <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">a pragmatist</span></a> who can adapt to the constraints of those institutions with diverse political interests.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But, in a polarised political climate, securing bipartisan support has been a major hurdle for Biden in articulating his geopolitical strategy and making decisions. Many Asian leaders are puzzled or dismayed by Biden’s inconsistencies.</p>First, the United States has a long-standing policy of “<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">strategic ambiguity</span></a>” based on the 1979 <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Taiwan Relations Act</span></a>. Under the act, the US does not commit to Taiwan’s defence, instead pledging to provide Taiwan with “arms of a defensive character”. Given this, Beijing was irritated when Biden <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">said on television last year</span></a> that the US would defend Taiwan from a PLA military assault.The <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">inconsistency</span></a> between Biden’s statement and official White House policy is perplexing, even contradictory. To subtly probe Biden’s position during their meeting last month in California, Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed his resolve to unify with Taiwan but avoided mentioning the possibility of force. In response, Biden toed the line based on the long-standing Taiwan Relations Act. <img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/12/04/cui-yonden---clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">30:18</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Why Taiwan is a ‘life-or-death question’ for China: Cui Tiankai on US-China tension</p><p>Why Taiwan is a ‘life-or-death question’ for China: Cui Tiankai on US-China tension</p>The Biden-Xi orchestrated meeting proceeded smoothly, but ended with a shock when Biden <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">called Xi a dictator</span></a>. This was not only impolite but also confusing, especially when the US wants to manage its relationship with China.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Second, while the US wants to become less dependent on China, Biden’s trade policy has been confusing, sending mixed signals to China and other Asian countries.</p>To pivot away from China, former president Barack Obama wanted the US to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership with 11 other countries in the Asia-Pacific. But his successor, Donald Trump, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">withdrew</span></a> from the pact as soon as he took office in 2017.Yet Biden, despite being a prime player in the effort to pass the trade pact as Obama’s vice-president, has <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">not joined</span></a> the successor to the pact, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. His decision could be due to strong opposition from Congress, but such flip-flops can create confusion at best and mistrust at worst.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Can US focus on Asia-Pacific while distracted by Ukraine, Middle East conflicts?</span></p></a></h3>Instead, Biden launched the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Indo-Pacific Economic Framework</span></a> (IPEF) in May last year with a dozen partners across the Indo-Pacific, including India. <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Four key pillars</span></a> make up the economic framework: trade facilitation, the establishment of supply chains, the improvement of infrastructure and decarbonisation, and taxation and anti-corruption.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unlike the Trans-Pacific Partnership, there are no market access or tariff reduction provisions in the framework, which lacks the trade incentives that regional partners desire. Indeed, many IPEF members want to establish a strong trade relationship with the US to counterbalance their economic ties with China.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/11/01/clean_-_thumbnail.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">11:11</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">CPTPP could become game changer and supplant 'out-of-date' WTO, after mainland China, Taiwan apply</p><p>CPTPP could become game changer and supplant 'out-of-date' WTO, after mainland China, Taiwan apply</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But without an explicit commitment towards developing trade incentives, many regional partners see the IPEF as essentially a political strategy to counter China, rather than a sincere and thoughtful economic policy integration initiative in Asia. Experts are also doubtful that it can succeed in reshaping China’s economic influence in the region.</p>Despite having <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">finalised</span></a> an agreement with 13 other countries on three IPEF pillars (supply chains, climate and anti-corruption), Biden decided not to sign any trade agreements at the Apec summit in November due to resistance from some Senate members.Many IPEF members were confused by Biden’s decision because they were <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">expecting progress</span></a> on the trade section of the framework. Besides confusion, IPEF members also have doubts about Biden’s commitment to improve trade with members.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In politics, flip-flops create confusion and mistrust. Biden needs a decisive strategy to keep his allies and supporters on board – a key lesson from Machiavelli, who may have influenced Kissinger’s realist thinking.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Christopher Tang is a distinguished professor at the UCLA Anderson School of Management</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLC5zJ6lrWefpbavtc6nZpqqpJ6wrbGObGltbGBsgXC0zrBkm6GUmru0ecWoqZ6hl6N6orrDZqurmZSaerG7y6KasmWWobaxecWlpqmrXZa%2FpnnCqKWfraOeu6h51KxkmqScnrK0</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
