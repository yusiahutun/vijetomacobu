And while some critics are applauding her and calling the film the perfect project to get her back in the swing of things post-baby —&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Vanity Fair</a>&nbsp;said the movie was a "reminder of why audiences fell in love with her in the first place" —&nbsp;other outlets are calling the R-rated movie "creepy" because of its premise and the age gap between the leads, Lawrence, 32, and Andrew Barth Feldman, who is 21.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For anyone who needs a quick rundown of the plot (spoilers ahead), it goes a little something like this, according to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>BuzzFeed</a>: "cash-strapped bartender who gets hired by a wealthy and overbearing couple to have sex with their 19-year-old son, Percy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Matthew Broderick and Laura Benanti — the actors that play Percy's parents in the film — addressed criticism that came from&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rolling Stone</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Independent</a>, who noted that the whole plot (which is based on a real Craigslist ad) is "creepy." Broderick and Benanti said that the critics missed the point and that everyone involved knows that the whole situation is “insane” and that the film is actually a “cautionary tale” for overbearing parents.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“If you are a helicopter parent who puts your child in such a bubble, they do not know how to exist outside of that bubble. You are going to make the exact opposite and insane choice, which is what they are doing here,” Benanti told the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Hollywood Reporter</a>&nbsp;at the movie's premiere. “I feel like it is a very satirical look at what can happen if you do not give your children a longer leash to figure things out for themselves. Otherwise, you’re going to end up curating their life forever.”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Broderick also commented on the matter, saying that he's encountered some over-the-top parents as he raised his children.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I guess what happens is when a kid goes off to school, it’s so frightening that they’ll be happy and they’ll make friends and they’ll take care of themselves that some parents go to any length to make that transition work,” he said. “And it’s a hard time … But you really have to let them make it on their own. But these parents decide to mess with nature.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the lead-up to the film's release, Lawrence even joked that the movie was “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>so offensive and so wrong</a>.” And for anyone keeping score, there were few critics calling out the 15-year age difference between Lawrence and Bradley Cooper in&nbsp;Silver Linings Playbook.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It goes the other way, too,” writer and director Gene Stupnitsky said. “We took great pains to be careful about the ick factor because it could go that way … We took a humanist approach, and I think that’s all you can ask for.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zahkoZmimXqnscSloKefo2Kwor%2FTZpidnKKawLR5wqugraGTnsCuecKrnJ6oqWKuqLGMoJipZZqau6%2B1xZ6pZqSRrL%2BmusKeZHBtZWiGeIE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
