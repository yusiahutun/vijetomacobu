So, meanwhile, we wait for the actor to appear on screen again, let’s delve into this “Chukwudi Iwuji Bio” to explore his partner, family, and net worth.</p><h3><strong>Chukwudi Iwuji On Peacemaker</strong></h3><p>Chukwudi Iwuji knew it was going to be a “sayonara” for his character in ep 7 of<i> Peacemaker </i>which aired in Feb 2022. “I got the script right from the start and knew his trajectory,” that actor shared in a Zoom interview.</p><p>Also, that actor went on to mention that if there were “breadcrumbs, it’s in the writing,” and not in his performance. He shared that he was “very careful to play it, moment to moment to moment.”</p><p>With that being said, although Chukwudi saw his ending from a mile away, he still was disappointed that he had to leave the HBO Max series. The actor even delivered a rendition of the classical Chopin song, “Prelude in E Minor (Op. 28, No.4),” paying a tribute to his character over IG.</p><p>Someday Chukwudi hopes that the comic book show can find a way to bring him back.&nbsp; “My spirit will be with the team. If there are more seasons, this is DC. People die and come back,” he remarked.</p><h3><strong>Chukwudi Iwuji On Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</strong></h3><p>As of 2022, Chukwudi Iwuji wasn’t allowed to reveal who he portrayed on<i> Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.</i> 3. However, he did say that his character gets a chance to interact with everyone in the<i> Guardians</i> main cast.</p><p>Also, back over one of his interviews, Chukwudi touched on some of the <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.</i> 3 rumors, including him portraying Silver Surfer — “I saw those (rumors) recently, I’ve seen that. I saw Silver Surfer, I saw Nova, I’ve seen (many). For me to wrap my head around the fact that I am the subject of speculation around the Internet is kind of fun. But I have to stay mum, I can’t tell you. I’d love to.”</p><p>So, since Chukwudi didn’t deny his possible role as Silver Surfer (who was previously played by Laurence Fishburne in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,) could he be the new Silver Surfer?</p><p>Well, speculations apart, let’s talk some facts about how he landed the role. You might be surprised but he didn’t go through any auditions or asked anyone to be in the movie. It was James Gun himself who approached him and said, “I want you to be (name omitted) in Guardians of the Galaxy 3.”</p><p>“And I remember it was one of the few genuine times of my life where I was speechless,” he recalled. Having the possibility/capability to hire anyone in the industry and the filmmaker chose Chukwudi, the actor was just baffled.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Chukwudi Iwuji Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Chukwudi Iwuji garnered a net worth of over $1 million by 2022.</p><p>The actor first started his career while he was still doing his major in Economics at <i>Yale University</i>.
