Years later in separate interviews, both Kutcher and Kunis reveal their own accounts of the pivotal night.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=86 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"She wanted me to like shotgun cigarette smoke so she could breathe it in and I was like 'All right,'" Kutcher says of their flirty exchanges at the party on The Howard Stern Show in June 2017. "It was kind of obvious that things were happening."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=87 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Meanwhile, Kunis shares in July 2016 that Kutcher actually tried to set her up blindly with one of his friends at the party.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=88 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"He was like, 'Come over,'" she says on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LGgfetILHU" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Late Late Show" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Late Late Show</a><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LGgfetILHU" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" with James Corden" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"> with James Corden</a>, "and he had a friend he wanted to set me up with—and that didn't happen."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=89 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Following the night at the party, Kunis and Kutcher begin to casually date.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=90 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We were just like, let's just hook up.

Though, despite their onscreen romance and close off-screen friendship, the two remain strictly platonic.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=94 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Per Kunis, the thought of a romantic relationship with Kutcher back then felt inappropriate "on all levels," she <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LGgfetILHU" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=says class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">says</a> on The Late Late Show in 2016. "Like, Ashton did my chemistry homework for me," she adds of their brother-sister relationship.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=95 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It was really awkward because I'm like a 19-year-old kid," Kutcher <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Ashton-Kutcher-Quote-About-First-Kiss-Mila-Kunis-2017-43668061 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=says class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">says</a> to Howard Stern of his dynamic with Kunis at the time. "She was 14! She was like my little sister. I wanted to make sure she was okay."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=96 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But the two maintain a friendship in the years following the show—speaking occasionally over AOL chat, Kunis later reveals, while also independently establishing their own lives. Throughout this 14-year period, Kutcher marries and divorces actress Demi Moore, and Kunis fully grows up.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ef84b592-a2b0-47e0-8e6c-e29e8d3ddc25_1619719162.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Sabrina Park" title="Headshot of Sabrina Park" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Sabrina Park is a Digital Fellow at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HarpersBAZAAR.com</a> where she covers news, fashion, and culture stories.
