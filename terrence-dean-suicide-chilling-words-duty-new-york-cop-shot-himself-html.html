that part of the reason why he was depressed was because he felt that his family had pressured him into becoming a police officer instead of pursuing his dream of being a fire fighter.<br></span></p><p><span>On Wednesday, the day before he died, Dean threatened to kill himself by putting his gun in his mouth while at home with Ms Stuart.</span></p><p><span>That same day, he stormed out of the house after the couple had a fight because Ms Stuart had left her engagement ring at work.
